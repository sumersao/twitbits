An emboldened Ukraine today said that it would not reopen ceasefire negotiations until the rebels had laid down their weapons entirely, the AP reports. The once undermanned and outgunned Ukrainian force is now noticeably better armed, using buses and pickup trucks alongside its armored vehicles to transport what the Telegraph describes as a \"motley mix\" of police, special forces, and militiamen. Ukraine says it has succeeded in sealing the Russian border, preventing troops and weapons from flowing to the rebels. But Vladimir Putin has been suspiciously silent, ignoring the separatists' increasingly urgent pleas for help, and many are speculating that he aims to cut his losses, having already taken the real prize of Crimea, the Wall Street Journal reports. Observers believe Moscow has ruled out any military intervention, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov struck a decidedly peaceful tone at a news conference, saying, \"A quick end to the bloodshed is in our common interest.\" But one US official cautioned against declaring victory. \"There is only one person who knows what Putin is planning,\" he said, \"and that is Putin.\"\n\nWeird news from the land of Charlie Sheen: The troubled actor has managed to irk a group of 9/11 truthers, which is now threatening to protest in front of his live shows. Members of the 9/11 Truth Movement, who believe 9/11 was a conspiracy, feel Sheen has betrayed them. Sheen was once very vocal about his belief in the truther movement (he said the World Trade Center collapse looked like a \"controlled demolition\"), but instead of \"asking hard questions about what happened on 9/11 and the resulting wars,\" a member tells TMZ, Sheen has been \"bragging about smoking crack and sleeping with hookers.\" In other Sheen-related news from TMZ, ex Brooke Mueller is back in rehab after a weeklong binge, having refused a drug test and engaged in some other strange behavior\u2014click here for more.\n\nSienna Miller is set to join the growing list of outraged public figures taking legal action over phone-hacking by reporters at Britain's News of the World. Lawyers for the star say she plans to add her name to those seeking a review of how the police handled the case and sources at the Rupert-Murdoch owned paper say she's taking steps toward suing it because reporters allegedly listened to her voicemails, the Guardian reports. (For background and opinion on the scandal, click here.) Miller's friends say she changed her number after noticing signs that somebody else was listening to her voicemail, but jailed reporter Glen Mulcaire appears to have obtained her new number as well, although police didn't notify her when they found her PIN code in his possession. A former News of the World reporter who says his editor asked him to hack phones was interviewed by British police last night, the BBC reports.", "- On July 23, 1992, Morrad Ghonim watched his 17-year-old wife die. The couple had taken their 6-month-old son to Creek Park in La Mirada, Calif. Ghonim said he felt uncomfortable after a group of people called out at his wife and he wanted to leave, reports the Los Angeles Times. But as they made to drive off, a gunman approached the passenger door, demanded money, and murdered his wife. Now, 24 years later, a jury has decided who was responsible for Vicki Ghonim's death: then-19-year-old Morrad Ghonim. The 43-year-old, who was extradited from Antigua last year, was on Monday found guilty of first-degree murder. The man who pulled the trigger, however, was Leon Martinez. Police got to Martinez by way of grant money earmarked for cold cases, reports the Whittier Daily News. A DNA test of pants found near the scene led them in 2010 to Martinez, who said Ghonim hired him and even reached over his wife's body to hand him payment. A friend of Martinez's relayed meeting a man days before Vicki's death who said he and his child's mother\u2014a student at John Glenn High, as Vicki was\u2014were having issues and planned to separate. In late January, the Daily News painted a picture of a confident defense, given that in exchange for testifying, Martinez will not serve life without parole for the murder, but instead 28 years to life. \"This is a 20-year-old murder that comes down to the credibility of a convicted killer and an ex-wife who hates Mr. Ghonim ... and promised to send him to hell,\" said one of Ghonim's lawyers, noting that Ghonim's second wife talked to police. Ghonim could be handed life without parole at his Dec. 19 sentencing.\n\nThe man who co-founded Pixar and is seen as the creative force behind blockbusters such as the Toy Story and Cars franchises will soon be out of a job at Disney. John Lasseter, 61, has been on leave from parent company Disney since November after allegations of improper workplace behavior surfaced, including his propensity to wrap up everyone he meets in long bear hugs. Disney announced Friday that Lasseter\u2014who previously acknowledged and apologized for his \"missteps\"\u2014will shift into a vague consulting role through the end of the year and then depart for good, reports the New York Times. Disney execs were wrestling for months with whether to allow Lasseter to return, but Deadline reports on a \"gathering sense\" among employees that he would not have been welcome. Disney chief Bob Iger issued a statement that praised Lasseter for \"reinventing the animation business, taking breathtaking risks, and telling original, high quality stories that will last forever,\u201d and Lasseter issued one of his own thanking Disney and saying he's \"extremely proud\" of his work but that it's time to move on. Despite the positive public comments, the move amounts to what the Los Angeles Times describes as \"a dramatic unraveling of one of the most storied careers in animation.\" The story notes that hugs were just a part of the problem, with female employees at Pixar alleging that Lasseter and other senior execs turned a blind eye to a corporate culture rife with crude jokes and inappropriate touching. (Actress and screenwriter Rashida Jones left Toy Story 4 and complained about Pixar's unequal treatment of women.)\n\nAfter Angela Lansbury said this week that women need to \"sometimes take the blame\" for sexual misconduct because they make themselves attractive to men, the backlash was fast and forceful. \"It is a deeply unhelpful myth that rape and other forms of sexual violence are caused or 'provoked' by women's sexuality or 'attractiveness,'\" ABC News quotes Rape Crisis England & Wales as saying. Actress Patricia Arquette added: \"It doesn't matter how young or old, how beautiful or homely. Rapists rape. End of story.\" Lansbury has now responded to her critics. \"There is no excuse whatsoever for men to harass women in an abusive sexual manner,\" Entertainment Weekly quotes the 92-year-old Murder She Wrote star as saying. \"And, I am devastated that anyone should deem me capable of thinking otherwise.\" Lansbury says she's \"a strong supporter of women's rights\" and is \"troubled by how quickly and brutishly some have taken my comments out of context and attempted to blame my generation, my age, or my mindset, without having read the entirety of what I said.\" To which the AV Club quips: \"Welcome to the internet, Dame Angela.\"", "- It may not surprise you to learn that Gwyneth Paltrow has sought to treat her ailments\u2014in this case inflammation and scarring\u2014by subjecting herself to the stings of live bees. \"It's a thousands-of-year-old treatment,\" the Goop mastermind told the New York Times in 2016. \"It's actually pretty incredible if you research it. But, man, it's painful.\" Now a report published in the Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology reveals what's believed to be the first death related to bee-sting therapy\u2014aka live bee acupuncture, aka bee venom apitherapy\u2014in someone who had previously shown tolerance for the treatment. In the case from 2015, a 55-year-old Spanish woman died of multiple organ failure after two years of the treatment to relieve muscular contracture and stress. In bee-sting therapy, bees placed on a patient's body have their heads squeezed until they extend their stingers, the Telegraph reports. The idea is that the stings cause inflammation and lead to an anti-inflammatory response from the body. The unnamed woman started wheezing and having shortness of breath during one of her monthly treatments at a private clinic before losing consciousness. She died weeks later at the hospital. Researchers say severe anaphylactic shock caused a \"massive watershed stroke and permanent coma,\" as well as the multiple organ failure. \"The risks of undergoing apitherapy may exceed the presumed benefits, leading us to conclude that this practice is both unsafe and unadvisable,\" one researcher says.

Caylee Anthony was last seen June 16, but was not reported missing for a full month. Crowder, who started a Change.org petition as well as a Facebook page asking Congress to create the law, says she was \"sickened\" when Casey Anthony was convicted only of lying to the police, and was not \"charged with child neglect or endangerment, or even obstruction of justice.\u201d Her Change.org petition is the fastest-growing campaign in the site's history, with nearly 2,000 people signing it each hour, the Washington Post reports.

One of the United Nations' chief investigators says evidence is building that sarin gas was used in the Syrian conflict\u2014but by rebels, not Bashar al-Assad's regime. \"Our investigators have been in neighboring countries interviewing victims, doctors, and field hospitals\" and \"there are strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin gas,\" said Carla Del Ponte, a member of a panel probing alleged Syrian war crimes, Reuters reports. \"This was use on the part of the opposition, the rebels, not by the government authorities,\" she adds. The war crimes inquiry commission Del Ponte is involved with is separate from the main UN probe into chemical weapons use in Syria. Each side accused the other of using chemical weapons during fighting in Aleppo in March, while Britain and France say they have evidence that regime forces used nerve agents in attacks on rebels. In other developments: Israeli airstrikes on targets inside Syria in recent days have killed at least 42 government soldiers, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights tells the AP. Israel today emphasized that the strikes were not meant to aid rebels, Reuters adds, but rather to block weapons from Hezbollah. The Israeli move renewed debate on whether the US should use airstrikes against the Assad regime, the New York Times reports. John McCain, who yesterday blasted President Obama's \"red line\" as being \"written in disappearing ink,\" said the strikes show that Syria's air defense system may not be much of an obstacle. Opposition activists say rebel forces shot down a military helicopter last night, killing eight government troops, the AP reports. The regime's air power has long been a chief target of rebels and activists say rebels also attacked and occupied parts of an air base in the north of the country yesterday, killing the base's commander and capturing a tank unit.", "- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says officials from Saudi Arabia, the United States, Germany, France, and Britain have listened to audio recordings related to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, the AP reports. Erdogan's comments on Saturday were the first public confirmation of the existence of recordings of the Oct. 2 killing of the Washington Post columnist at the consulate where he'd gone to get papers to marry his fiancee. \"We gave the tapes,\" Erdogan said Saturday before departing for Paris, where he'll attend events with other world leaders marking the armistice that ended World War I, per Al Jazeera. \"They have listened to all the conversations in them. They know.\" NBC News notes that a State Department rep had previously denied that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had heard any such audio or seen any audio transcript when he visited Turkey last month. President Trump, meanwhile, has said that the US has asked for any audio \"if it exists.\" Erdogan called on Saudi Arabia to rid itself of the \"stain\" by cooperating with Turkey over the investigation. Erdogan said a 15-member team that Turkey says was sent to kill Khashoggi know who's behind the killing, as well as the location of his remains. (Saudis are boycotting Amazon over coverage of Khashoggi's murder.)\n\nEwan McGregor and his wife of 22 years have split, People reports. The news came Sunday after the Sun published photos of McGregor, 46, kissing his Fargo co-star Mary Elizabeth Winstead, 32, in a busy London caf\u00e9. A customer tells the tabloid the pair seemed \"relaxed\" together and were \"deep in conversation\" for more than an hour. \"As they left she got on to the back of Ewan\u2019s motorbike and they sped off together,\" the customer says. The US actress split from her husband of seven years, Riley Stearns, in May, per The Sun. That was the same month a family source tells People the Star Wars star split from French wife Eve Mavrakis, 51, a production designer. The pair met on the set of the British TV series Kavanagh QC and have four daughters, Clara, 21, Jamyan, 16, Esther, 15, and Anouk, 6. The splits follow other high-profile breakups: Fergie and Josh Duhamel called it quits in September, weeks after Amber Heard and Elon Musk.\n\nIs the era of sugary sports drinks coming to an end? Gatorade is launching its new Gatorade Zero this week, a sports drink with no sugar and no carbohydrates. Gatorade has long dominated the sports drink industry, but as health-conscious consumers have begun eschewing sugar, some have soured on the drink\u2014which has 34 grams of sugar per 20 ounces\u2014sending sales down 0.5% last year, CNNMoney reports. Gatorade has previously tried an organic version and a low-calorie version with less sugar. Gatorade Zero, which will be known as G Zero, per Bloomberg, will compete directly with Powerade Zero, a sugar-free sports drink that entered the market 10 years ago."]}]
