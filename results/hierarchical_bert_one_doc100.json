The couple had taken their 6-month-old son to Creek Park in La Mirada, Calif. Ghonim said he felt uncomfortable after a group of people called out at his wife and he wanted to leave, reports the Los Angeles Times. But as they made to drive off, a gunman approached the passenger door, demanded money, and murdered his wife. Now, 24 years later, a jury has decided who was responsible for Vicki Ghonim's death: then-19-year-old Morrad Ghonim. The 43-year-old, who was extradited from Antigua last year, was on Monday found guilty of first-degree murder. The man who pulled the trigger, however, was Leon Martinez. Police got to Martinez by way of grant money earmarked for cold cases, reports the Whittier Daily News. A DNA test of pants found near the scene led them in 2010 to Martinez, who said Ghonim hired him and even reached over his wife's body to hand him payment. A friend of Martinez's relayed meeting a man days before Vicki's death who said he and his child's mother\u2014a student at John Glenn High, as Vicki was\u2014were having issues and planned to separate. In late January, the Daily News painted a picture of a confident defense, given that in exchange for testifying, Martinez will not serve life without parole for the murder, but instead 28 years to life. \"This is a 20-year-old murder that comes down to the credibility of a convicted killer and an ex-wife who hates Mr. Ghonim ... and promised to send him to hell,\" said one of Ghonim's lawyers, noting that Ghonim's second wife talked to police.

John Lasseter, 61, has been on leave from parent company Disney since November after allegations of improper workplace behavior surfaced, including his propensity to wrap up everyone he meets in long bear hugs. Disney announced Friday that Lasseter\u2014who previously acknowledged and apologized for his \"missteps\"\u2014will shift into a vague consulting role through the end of the year and then depart for good, reports the New York Times. Disney execs were wrestling for months with whether to allow Lasseter to return, but Deadline reports on a \"gathering sense\" among employees that he would not have been welcome. Disney chief Bob Iger issued a statement that praised Lasseter for \"reinventing the animation business, taking breathtaking risks, and telling original, high quality stories that will last forever,\u201d and Lasseter issued one of his own thanking Disney and saying he's \"extremely proud\" of his work but that it's time to move on. Despite the positive public comments, the move amounts to what the Los Angeles Times describes as \"a dramatic unraveling of one of the most storied careers in animation.\" The story notes that hugs were just a part of the problem, with female employees at Pixar alleging that Lasseter and other senior execs turned a blind eye to a corporate culture rife with crude jokes and inappropriate touching.

The war crimes inquiry commission Del Ponte is involved with is separate from the main UN probe into chemical weapons use in Syria.

Martin Bailey says Van Gogh didn't take a razor to his ear because of an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, though the two did quarrel that day in 1888, the Guardian reports. Instead, Van Gogh cut his ear off because he had learned that his brother, Theo, was going to get married, Bailey says. He says the struggling artist feared that the marriage would end his close relationship with his brother\u2014and that it would cause Theo to cut off the financial support Van Gogh relied on. Bailey says that Van Gogh didn't learn of the engagement while he was recovering in hospital, as previously thought, but in a letter that was delivered to him in Provence just hours before the self-mutilation. \"Had Van Gogh been elated by the engagement, it is virtually inconceivable that he would have sliced off part of his ear a few hours after receiving Theo\u2019s news, whatever other difficulties he was facing,\" Bailey writes in new book Studio of the South, per the Telegraph.

But during two interviews with investigators, the story shifted: Per court documents, Holmes first said she was at home heating up pasta as her parents argued, heard a shot, walked past her father and saw her mother's body, then grabbed a gun and killed her father downstairs. During the next interview, she allegedly added details: She said she entered the home a second time to get her mom's phone, changed her clothes, and moved her dad's body. After securing a search warrant for Holmes' phone, investigators say they discovered a web search for \"scary movies where kids kill parents,\" rap lyrics expressing a desire to see her dad dead, and a Feb. 15 video of a dancing, gun-toting Holmes in her bedroom. They also allegedly uncovered a stick-figure drawing in a backpack featuring \"me\" and \"dad\"; \"me\" held a gun.

The heavily edited video, taken from a surveillance camera, shows a car coming under fire during what the military describes as a series of ambushes that left four soldiers and six suspects dead in Palmarito on May 3. As soldiers surround the vehicle, its occupants exit and are forced to lie down in front of the car. Soldiers are then seen dragging a suspect to the same spot. He appears injured but rolls from his back onto his front. Six minutes later, a soldier appears at the side of the frame and appears to shoot the man in the back of the head, per the AP. A dark stain spreads around him, reports Reuters. \"There was already concern about the use of excessive force by the military. Now this video seems to give us the proof,\" says the chairwoman of Mexico's Senate Commission on Human Rights, per the Washington Post, which identifies the man shot as Raul Jimenez Martinez, 46. Mexico's defense ministry, however, says it will cooperate fully with an investigation launched by the attorney general's office on May 4. \"Under no circumstances can conduct contrary to the law and human rights be justified,\" the ministry says. Residents of Palmarito have already taken to the streets to protest the deaths of the suspects, placing the blame on the army, though the defense ministry previously claimed the suspects used residents as human shields.\n\nLiberals have been accusing recent GOP-led voter ID laws of aiming to disenfranchise minorities, who tend to vote Democrat. Now former Florida GOP chairman Jim Greer is saying on record that, yes, those laws are actually about stopping black people from voting, reports Salon, picking up on a story in the Tampa Bay Times. \u201cI was upset because the political consultants and staff were talking about voter suppression and keeping blacks from voting,\u201d Greer said, recalling a 2009 meeting with party officials. Greer also said the party's budget committee had been taken over by \"whack-a-do, right-wing crazies.\" Greer is hardly without an axe to grind, though. His statements came from a 630-page deposition made in May as part of his trial on corruption charges. Greer paid a company he owned nearly $200,000 from GOP coffers while he was the chairman, although he contends it was authorized and made for services rendered. Florida state Sen.

Making her story even more believable: Police reported that they found a sticker on her driver's license reading, \"I [heart symbol] Jesus/Tim Tebow.\" But, when police asked the Colorado woman to specify what type of relationship she meant, she said it wouldn't be appropriate to say; when asked if it was a friendly, platonic, romantic, or matrimonial relationship, she claimed \"all of the above\" while giggling. She went so far as to claim that her current address was the same as Tebow's in Jacksonville, because they live together, and she gave police a Jacksonville address, Action News Jax reports.

That's only the first eyebrow-raiser about the country's electoral process, held every four years so voters can \"choose\" mayors, governors, and local assemblies. North Koreans over age 17 are not only required to show, they're also told which preapproved candidates to vote for by placing already prepared ballots in the ballot boxes, CNN notes. And according to Sky, it was a \"festive atmosphere,\" with voters \"singing and dancing\" as they cast votes. \"All participants took part in the elections with extraordinary enthusiasm to cement the revolutionary power,\" the Korean Central News Agency proclaimed. Voting is simple: To vote \"yes\" for the candidate predetermined by Kim Jong Un's Workers' Party, participants just place their ballot in the correct box; those who vote \"no\" place their ballot in a separate box, all within view of elections officials, the Economist explained in 2014. Abstaining or voting no is viewed as treason, the BBC notes. The real reason for even having the vote is basically to serve as a census of sorts and to keep track of no-show defectors, NK News notes. A professor of Asian studies explains that this election system makes even more extreme the one used in the Soviet Union during the Cold War, including the ridiculously high turnout rates. \"People used to joke that on the day of elections that no one would dare to die in North Korea, let alone lose consciousness,\" he says.

While more than 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were fired, none of the senior executives are losing their jobs.

But last month's budget contained language that forces the government to plan for restarting these paper mailings. Ridiculous? Not according to a group called Consumers for Paper Options, which lobbied for that change and has since 2010 been \"advocating for access to paper-based services and information,\" as the group puts it. But though the group says it's a \"coalition of individuals and organizations,\" it's actually a product of the paper industry, the Washington Post reports: It was established by the Envelope Manufacturers Association and gets funding from the top paper-industry trade group. The Treasury expects to save $1 billion over a decade following its 2013 move to largely paperless communications, noting that processing a paper check costs $1.25, which is $1.16 cents more than the cost of an electronic payment.

The Wisconsin State Journal reports on the unidentified 32-year-old man at the center of it all, showing up Tuesday at a Madison police station to turn himself in for what he'd intended to do: take pictures up women's skirts by using a shoe camera. The Washington Post notes it's not exactly clear what a \"shoe camera\" is, but the man apparently was able to attach some kind of photographic device to his shoe and was testing it at home when the battery exploded, injuring his foot, Officer David Dexheimer tells the Journal. After getting treatment for the minor burns he received from the mini-blast, the man confessed his unsavory intentions to a clergyman, who encouraged him to turn himself in to police, Dexheimer says. There's a Wisconsin law on the books that outlaws anyone from purposely installing a device to photograph or otherwise record under a person's clothes without that person's consent, but the man in this case caught a lucky break: Per Madison Police Chief Mike Koval's daily \"significant calls\" blog, \"the subject was counseled on his actions and released from the scene as no illicit video had been taken.\" Koval notes there is an ongoing investigation, however.

The New York Times reports those videos, shot by overheard aircraft on March 4, 2002, may show Air Force Technical Sergeant John Chapman fighting al-Qaeda militants and killing two while alone on a mountaintop in Afghanistan. What's so shocking about the footage is not just the bravery. It's that Chapman was supposed to be dead. He was originally there with members of SEAL Team 6, providing support as their radioman. In the midst of a fierce and disastrous operation, Senior Chief Petty Officer Britt Slabinski determined the men needed to get off the mountain. Slabinski couldn't verify the wounded Chapman was dead, but he was nearly certain. So a \"dead\" Chapman was left behind. The Air Force now suspects Chapman was alive for roughly another hour and tried to provide cover for a helicopter carrying Army Ranger reinforcements (three Rangers were among seven Americans to die that day; some say blame rests at the SEALs' feet). The conclusion comes thanks to technology that assigns those on the ground a pixel signature that can be tracked even when ground cover blocks a man from view. The Air Force secretary wants Chapman given the Medal of Honor; SEAL Team 6 has no issue with that, but hasn't taken a stance on whether Chapman was alive. Slabinski is outwardly skeptical, and suggests the Air Force would welcome a Medal of Honor, which it hasn't seen one of its own get since Vietnam. But a fresh look at Chapman's autopsy may provide further proof he was alive.

More than 850 flights have been canceled out of Chicago's O'Hare International and Midway International airports after an employee allegedly set a fire in the basement of a major Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control center around 6am local time.

Essentially, \"it's a very basic form of word generation,\" researcher Andy Russell tells the BBC. The team started out by listening to chestnut-crowned babbler birds. Rather than sing, they produce \"discrete calls made up of smaller, acoustically distinct individual sounds,\" an expert says in a press release. Two sounds, identified as \"A\" and \"B,\" kept getting repeated. For example, the birds used an \"AB\" call to tell other birds where they were while in flight (listening birds would look to the sky), while a \"BAB\" call told chicks it was feeding time (listening birds would look at nests). Rearranging the sounds of the flight call to produce the latter call showed no alteration in the birds' behavior, and vice versa, proving the individual sounds were in fact the same. \"Although the two babbler bird calls are structurally very similar, they are produced in totally different behavioral contexts and listening birds are capable of picking up on this,\" a researcher explains. Russell adds, per the Christian Science Monitor, the babblers may communicate this way because it's easier to swap existing sounds than make up new ones. What's perhaps most fascinating is that researchers believe the birds' \"B\" sound differentiates the meaning of the call. In other words, it's the \"c\" that discerns the words \"cat\" and \"at\" in the English language. Such distinguishing elements are called phonemes, and this basic example \"might help us understand how the ability to generate new meaning initially evolved in humans,\" an expert says. \"It could be that when phoneme structuring first got off the ground in our hominid ancestors, this is the form it initially took.\" Russell says the ability likely exists in other animals.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book\u2014Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.\u201d\n\nGolf may be \"a good walk, spoiled,\" but at least it doesn't spoil your life expectancy. In fact, a new study finds that heavy cardio sports like cycling and rowing do nothing to help you live longer than playing golf or cricket, reports the Wall Street Journal. Researchers looked at mortality rates in 9,889 Olympic athletes who completed from 1896 to 1936 in 43 types of sports, and surprisingly found that those who competed in intense activities did not live any longer than those who curled, shot guns, played cricket, or golfed. \"Engaging in cycling and rowing (high cardiovascular intensity) had no added survival benefit compared with playing golf or cricket (low cardiovascular intensity),\" says the study. One theory is that intensive exercise over the long-term also leads to injuries and damage that balance out the benefits of such exercise. \"Over time, this will result in an accumulation of damage, which can be explained as a form of aging,\" says a study author.

Now, Podesta says, Comey should explain why \"he took this unprecedented step, particularly when he said himself in the letter to the Hill that these (emails) may not even be significant.\" The candidate herself kept up the attack on Comey, notes CNN, telling a crowd on Saturday that \"it's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election. In fact, it's not just strange, it's unprecedented and it's deeply troubling because voters deserve to get full and complete facts.\" Elsewhere: Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says Comey was between a rock and a hard place, and could have been accused of meddling with the election if he hadn't made the disclosure. Meanwhile, Team Trump is walking back its previous criticism of the FBI's handling of the investigation into Clinton's email. Tim Kaine says Comey needs to tell the public if he hasn't yet reviewed any of the emails considered \"pertinent\" to the investigation, and says that as far as the campaign knows, Comey \"knows nothing about the content of these emails.\" He calls it a \"distraction\" but says the Clinton campaign will \"power forward\" during the last 10 days. Mike Pence says the scandal shows that Clinton is \"just a risky choice in this election.\" He adds that Trump has \"made it clear we'll have the resources we need,\" and praises his \"incredible generosity.\" Clinton's close relationship with top aide Huma Abedin is being put to the test, reports the New York Times.

The genome research team\u2014the first to be led by Australian scientists\u2014sequenced the genome in 2008 but finally completed its analysis of it and published those findings last week. \"It's been a huge project,\" says one scientist. \"I'm from Australia and it was going on when I was an undergraduate there 10 years ago.\" The decoding gives scientists a clearer picture of mammalian evolution and could help cure diseases, both in humans and other mammals. Kangaroo milk has antibiotic properties, and researchers have copied it to synthesize a protein that kills bacteria already resistant to antibiotics, the Australian reports. The findings could lead to a vaccine to fend off a facial tumor that has ravaged Tasmanian devil populations\u2014though such a medication could be a decade away."}, {"generated_summaries": ["Not long after wrapping up their string of Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals, Amazon has pulled back the curtain on yet another way they\u2019ll be snagging purchases away from physical retail outlets.Starting this Saturday, users of Amazon\u2019s Price Check app will be able to score up to $5 off a purchase of any product if they use the app in-store.https://www.amazon.com/store/price-check-app.htmlhttps://t.co/eOQ8XtUeKdGhttps://twitter.com/#status/109898980060891e0#ref=twsrc%5Etfw%7Curl%7E%20to%20Amazon%20Store%20with%20Price%20Check%7A%20App%20Download%20and%20Use%20of%20Your%20Mobile%20Phone%20Kit.%20As%20iPhone%20Service%20Finds%20The%20Apps%20Where%20Are%20On%20the%20Net%20Of%20Universities%20In%20America%20%20New%Etowards%20Education%20Full%Equality%20For%20Students.%2C%20Schools.%3A%\ufffdhttps://goo.gl/2OQtU8XeJhttps://youtu.be/eQ8EtUoE8XdG?t=tunes&hl=en&v=youtu.jshttps://youtube.tv/playlist?list=0&playlist.php?f=1&list.flag%2F%2E%B1%B4%B3%B2%B0%B7%B6%B5%B9%B8%B10%B12%B11%B13%B09%B03%B04%B07%B08%B05%B00%B06%B01%B15%B02%B14%B53%B58%B41%B57%B48%B37%B50%B46%B55%B52%B51%B40%B47%B36%B45%B56%B43%B42%B59%B54%B31%B19%B18%B33"], "gt_summaries": "- Critics dubbed Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity \"extraordinary,\" and moviegoers this weekend sealed the deal: The George Clooney-Sandra Bullock space drama soared to No. 1 at the box office, with a $55.6 million opening that set a record for an October debut.

Months later, Pauline Levinsons spied her daughter's photo on the cover of the Nazi magazine Sonne ins Hause.

MLive.com reports that all six were charged with misconduct in office, with willful neglect of duty and various conspiracy charges also being assigned. Schuette filed criminal charges in April against two other state employees and a city water utility official. In the Department of Health and Human Services, alleged transgressions include reliance on shoddy data and hiding or ignoring bloodstream test results that indicated the significant presence of lead. Within the Department of Environmental Quality, accusations include workers manipulating water monitoring reports, purposely \"misinterpreting\" federal drinking-water standards, and trying to mislead the EPA, as well as suggesting ways to keep an EPA expert quiet about concerns. Shekter-Smith, meanwhile, is said to have turned a blind eye as evidence of water contamination became clearer.

The fight is between a spam-fighting group, Spamhaus, and a web-hosting company, Cyberbunker, but it has grown to the point that it's affecting the entire Internet and its infrastructure. Millions of users are experiencing delays while trying to reach websites or while using services like Netflix, and experts fear that if the attacks continue to grow in power, people may not be able to access things like email or online banking. It all started when Spamhaus, which publishes a blacklist that email providers use to weed out spam, put Cyberbunker on its list of spammers. Cyberbunker retaliated, but its attack on Spamhaus ended up having a much larger impact. One architect at a digital content provider likened it to, as the New York Times puts it, using a machine gun in an effort to assassinate one person. The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks \"are essentially like nuclear bombs\" that exploit the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS), says an exec at a group that tried to defend against the attacks and ended up becoming a target. \"It's so easy to cause so much damage.\" And, notes the architect, this is \"the largest publicly announced DDoS attack in the history of the Internet.\" Cyberbunker says Spamhaus is a vigilante group \"abusing [its] influence,\" but the architect notes that Cyberbunker is \"just mad\" that it got caught spamming. One security researcher says the only way to stop the attack is to arrest the people responsible. Five cyber-police forces around the globe are investigating.\n\nOne more for the gold, and seemingly nothing can prevent it.

With an approval rating that low, it is hard to find anything that is actually less popular than Congress.In the nearly half a century-long history of Gallup polling, the only people or institutions that have been more unpopular than the current Congress are Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and Mark Fuhrman, a detective in the O.J.

Though the topic seems destined for the courts, the FCC's decision \"is going to be a benchmark,\" a researcher tells USA Today. The board is expected to approve chairman Tom Wheeler's guidelines to regulate the Internet like a utility, as President Obama suggested. His proposal also labels broadband providers as \"common carriers\" under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, which means the FCC could prohibit paid prioritization for \"fast lanes,\" NBC News reports. What does that mean for you? \"All this ruling means is that there will be FCC jurisdiction to examine practices and hear complaints,\" a legal professor explains. He bats down claims that this is \"an all-or-nothing decision that will transform the Internet,\" suggesting much is still to be determined. \"Your broadband will still cost the same amount as it did before.\" Essentially Wheeler's rules would mean Internet service providers must treat all traffic equally, which is why Netflix\u2014which claims almost 35% of peak traffic in the US\u2014supports the move. It can't be charged more for the bandwidth it uses. Companies like Etsy, Kickstarter, Tumblr, and Vimeo support rules similar to Wheeler's. In the past, so did Google. But nearly a decade after Google and Facebook first pushed for new rules, the search giant has urged the FCC to draft rules boosting investment in broadband Internet networks, as have net neutrality opponents AT&T and Comcast, the Wall Street Journal reports. An expert predicts the \"public utility-style regulations\" will \"create a tremendous amount of chaos\" for cable and Internet companies, particularly when it comes to addressing congestion. They would have to ensure their practices of freeing up bandwidth are \"reasonable,\" NPR reports. The rules also include what's called \"zero-rating,\" which is when an app or group of apps\u2014for example T-Mobile's Music Freedom plan\u2014isn't counted against a user's data cap. Sounds like a bonus, right? \"That distorts competition,\" says one expert. Republicans generally consider Wheeler's rules a government power grab.

Four members of the Wagner family were arrested Tuesday, and authorities say a custody dispute played a role in the murders, the AP reports. Edward \"Jake\" Wagner, now 26, was the ex-boyfriend of Hanna Rhoden, 19, who was killed while lying in bed with her 4-day-old baby girl. Wagner was not the newborn's father, but shared custody of another daughter, Sophia, now 5, with Rhoden. Sophia was not with her mother when she was murdered; the newborn as well as two of her young cousins who were present were not hurt. (This chart shows how all the victims were related.) Also arrested, per Cincinnati.com: Wagner's parents George \"Billy\" Wagner III, 47, and Angela Wagner, 48, and his brother George Wagner IV, 27. All four have been charged with eight counts of aggravated murder and also face a slew of other charges. The mothers of both elder Wagners were also arrested and accused of forging custody documents in an alleged cover-up of the crimes. Citing a \"fixation\" and \"obsession\" the Wagner family allegedly had with the custody situation, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said Tuesday the situation is \"the most bizarre story I've ever seen. It's just amazing.\" Authorities say the Wagners knew the Rhodens well and spent months studying their routines and the layouts of their homes. But the Wagners have long denied involvement and insisted they were close friends with the Rhodens; they moved to Alaska after the killings due, they said, to intense speculation over their possible involvement in the case. \"Sophia is getting older,\" Jake Wagner (who also set up a GoFundMe for custody-related legal bills in the wake of the massacre) said at the time, so they moved \"so she wouldn\u2019t hear it.\" They were arrested, however, in Ohio and Kentucky. (See all our previous coverage of the massacre.)\n\nYou can temporarily take Donald Trump out of real estate, but you can't take the real estate out of Donald Trump. That much was clear at a Singapore press conference Tuesday, which took place after the president's meeting with Kim Jong Un and in which he touched upon the potential of North Korea's coastline. \"They have great beaches,\" Trump noted, per the Washington Examiner. \"You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean.\" And that spectacular view got him to thinking: \"Wouldn't that make a great condo? Instead of doing that you could have the best hotels in the world right there. Think of it from a real estate perspective, you have South Korea, you have China, and they own the land in the middle, how bad is that, right? It's great.\" The AP also reports on another post-summit activity, which it deems a \"classic alpha male move\": Trump showing off \"The Beast,\" the presidential limousine, to the North Korean leader. CNN shows a video clip of the two men approaching the limo, a Secret Service agent opening the door, and Kim peering in to take a look. \"We know that these men were trying to find ways to bond, in just like a personal, human way, and what's more natural for guys [than] to want to check out one another's car,\" Chris Cuomo notes.

But by March 23, he was dead, having never left the hospital. What happened in between is a series of missteps, starting with the Jan. 2 transplant. Two months after the transplant his family learned what went wrong that day: The defibrillator Dr. Masahiro Ono tried to use to \"jolt the new heart into rhythm\" wasn't working; he said he had to pump it by hand for 10 minutes until a working one was found. The donor heart was damaged and weakened as a result and wouldn't strengthen; it was eventually swapped for an artificial heart. Then came strokes, infection in Lewis' bloodstream, and what the family says was another equipment mishap that left him brain-dead.

Things have gone downhill from there. But amid poverty and heroin woes, the city of 21,000 has \"turned for the worst,\" Jessica Sayre tells the Washington Post. Her 26-year-old sister, Tiffany, a sex worker battling a drug problem, went missing from a local motel on May 11. Her naked body was found wrapped in a sheet in a drainage pipe on Saturday, making her the fourth woman to turn up dead near Chillicothe's waterways in the last year. At least two more women have vanished, leading some to fear a serial killer is on the loose. \"I don't want to come out and say 'yes, we have a serial killer,'\" says an officer, but he admits it's possible. The location of the women's bodies isn't the only evidence linking the cases. Most of the victims had drug issues and some were prostitutes; some even knew each other, reports the Post, which rounded up coverage from the Columbus Dispatch and Huffington Post. Friends Charlotte Trego, 27, and Tameka Lynch, 30, were the first to disappear, separately, on May 3, 2014. Lynch was found dead of a suspected drug overdose in a creek weeks later; her mom told the Dispatch she was afraid of water. Wanda Lemons, 38; Shasta Himelrick, 20; and Timberly Claytor later vanished; the bodies of the latter two were ultimately found. Himelrick was pregnant; the five other women all had children.

Researchers have presented a small study suggesting for the first time that air pollutants can make their way from a pregnant woman's lungs to her placenta, reports the Guardian. Because the placenta allows nutrients and oxygen to flow from the woman's blood stream to her fetus, that means it could similarly allow pollutants into the womb as well, per CNN. \"Our evidence suggests that this is indeed possible,\" says Norrice Liu, a pediatrician who led the research at Queen Mary University in London. \"We also know that the particles do not need to get into the baby's body to have an adverse effect, because if they have an effect on the placenta, this will have a direct impact on the fetus.\" The study, presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Paris, was indeed small, involving just five women. But researchers found \"black sooty\" particles, believed to be carbon, in the placentas of each one, says another of the researchers, Lisa Miyashita. Further analysis is in the works to confirm, but the results mirror similar ones in animals. Given previous research laying out the potential dangers that air pollution can cause to babies, the scientists say the study should factor into the advice given to pregnant women, even if it's as simple as wearing a mask or avoiding especially busy roads when out and about. The good news: All five of the women gave birth to healthy babies. (Air pollution might be the world's greatest killer.)\n\nThe Southern Avenger rides alone once more.

The researchers say the rate of ice loss has tripled over the last decade and the melting ice sheets are now pushing up sea levels around the world by around a half-millimeter every year, reports the BBC.

The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"\u2014and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they\u2019re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that\u2019s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it\u2019s the area that we\u2019re most worried about, because it\u2019s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried.

Noting that crucial demographic, Coach CEO Victor Luis says in a company release Monday that Kate Spade has a \"strong awareness among consumers, especially millennials.\" Coach will pay $18.50 per share of Kate Spade, a 9% premium to its Friday closing price of $16.97. It follows another recent millennial-minded deal on Coach's part: engaging Selena Gomez (and, it likely hopes, her 120 million Instagram fans) in a deal that will put her in Coach ads and across its social media, reports CNBC. But the brand isn't just going younger, it's going luxe-er, reports the AP: Coach has made an aggressive push to polish its image as a purveyor of opulence, ending many of the promotions it had used to ramp up sales. To power future growth, it's begun to build an empire of luxury brands. In 2015, Coach acquired the high-end footwear company Stuart Weitzman. Last month the company hired Joshua Schulman, the president of Neiman Marcus's Bergdorf Goodman division, and put him in the newly created position as president and CEO of the Coach brand. In CNN Money's view, the acquisition is \"bad news for purse-loving bargain hunters.\" It cites Coach's CFO as saying that Kate Spade will likely reel in the number of \"online flash sales\" it has."}, {"generated_summaries": ["The House passed legislation on Friday that allows insurance companies to offer health plans that were cancelled for not meeting new requirements under ObamaCare.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Thirty-nine Democrats broke with their party's leaders and backed the bill despite a veto threat by the White House, highlighting the political problem the issue has come for President Obama\u2019s party.Only four Republicans opposed it.."], "gt_summaries": "- This may not displease Donald Trump, but he has most definitely drawn the ire of two media establishment heavyweights over recent comments on three issues in particular\u2014his claim that big crowds were cheering the 9/11 attacks in New Jersey, that President Obama plans to bring in at least 200,000 Syrian refugees, and that African Americans are behind most white homicides.

The fixes aren't exactly high-tech: North Korean soldiers were seen digging a big trench in the border area where the soldier first drove and then ran to freedom, reports Reuters. They also planted trees, apparently to prevent vehicles from getting through in the future. Finally, North Korea also seems to have replaced all of its border security guards, reports the Yonhap news agency, which surmises that any officers involved are in for serious punishment. Details and developments: The soldier: \"He's a pretty nice guy,\" the lead South Korean surgeon says of the 24-year-old defector, identified only by the name \"Oh.\" The patient likes Bruce Almighty and CSI, though USA Today notes it's unclear whether he saw that US movie and show in the hospital or previously in North Korea on the black market. Oh faces a long recuperation, having been shot at least five times. One bullet decimated his colon. The surgeon: The incident has put the spotlight, again, on 48-year-old trauma surgeon Lee Cook-jong. Lee is the one giving regular updates after the surgeries he performs, and the Washington Post reports that he previously became a \"national hero\" in 2011 when he saved the life of a ship captain shot by Somali pirates. That feat became the subject of a medical drama. Lee, blind in one eye, also served as the inspiration for a character in a second drama called Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim, which was released last year and gave him certifiable celeb status. The Post uses the terms \"heartthrob\" and \"McDreamy\" in the profile. Next for Oh: The surgeon, taking note of Oh's \"jarhead\" haircut, jokingly suggested that Oh eventually join the South Korean military: \"He smiled and said that he would never ever go back to the military system again.\" When he's stronger, Oh will be debriefed. Then he'll get help with housing, education, and job training from the South Korean government, reports the Guardian.\n\nMore bad news for President Obama on ObamaCare today: The House passed legislation widely seen as undermining the health-care law, and 39 Democrats joined Republicans in favor, reports the Washington Post. The bill from Michigan Republican Fed Upton would guarantee that people whose policies got canceled under ObamaCare would be able to keep them. President Obama addressed the problem yesterday with an administrative fix, but Upton's bill goes further. While the president's fix says the plans can remain available for only another year, Upton's measure seeks to keep them around permanently, reports the Hill. (The White House has promised a veto if the bill gets through the Senate, where its prospects are uncertain.) Some dueling quotes, as noted by the New York Times: Upton: \"Cancellation notices are now arriving in millions of mailboxes across the country. It\u2019s cancellation today, sticker shock tomorrow.\u201d Democrat Mike Doyle: \u201cDon\u2019t pretend you care about the American people\u2019s health care here.

The Rabbs' fringe-limbed tree frog wasn't even discovered until 2005 when scientists were attempting to rescue specimens of any amphibian they could before a deadly chytrid fungal infection hit Panama. According to National Geographic, Toughie made it out of Panama, but it's estimated that the chytrid fungus killed up to 85% of all amphibians left behind in his natural habitat. He had lived in isolation at the Garden since 2008. A cause of death is unknown, but Toughie was believed to be at least 12 years old. In his final years, Toughie became a \"symbol of the extinction crisis.\" His photo was projected onto St. Peter's Basilica, and he was visited by film directors and race car drivers. \"A lot of people were moved to tears when they saw him,\" a photographer who worked with Toughie says. \"When you have the very last of something it's a special deal.\u201d While some scientists are holding out hope for the Rabbs' tree frog, it's likely Toughie was the last, Scientific American reports.

She's a biologist in British Columbia who was willing to tolerate 180,000 bites as a host for the creatures so that her team could study them. \"I calmed myself down thinking when human beings were still living in caves, they were probably bitten by bedbugs, by fleas, by mice and who knows what,\" she tells the Canadian Press via CTV. \"So I think humans can endure this, and I'm lucky enough that I have no side effects, that I just can handle it.\" It seems her work has paid off. The researchers, including Gries' husband, found a histamine molecule that, to the bugs, indicates a \"safe space,\" the Press reports; once the bugs find it, they stick around. The researchers lured them to the trap using a pheromone blend and components from the bedbugs' own feces; the histamine then keeps them there. The cost of the chemicals? Less than a dime per trap. \"The biggest challenge in dealing with bedbugs is to detect the infestation at an early stage,\" Gries' husband tells Simon Fraser University News. \"This trap will help landlords, tenants, and pest-control professionals determine whether premises have a bedbug problem, so that they can treat it quickly.\" The trap should be on the market next year, CBC reports. That's particularly good news for Chicago, which was reported earlier this year to be America's worst city for bedbugs.

The home is a rental, and the owner happened to be there doing maintenance work\u2014and spotted a trail of blood. He looked inside the can around 4:30pm and saw the infant among bloody towels. Ferguson told police she had placed the child in a plastic grocery bag and wrapped him in a pink blanket after giving birth \"on or about April 21,\" reports WYFF.

At least seven Afghans died in the attack, and 17 were hurt. Officials believe the insurgents disguised themselves as women in order to get weapons into the building, which is under construction, the Washington Post adds. \"We strongly believe they used burkas,\" which were found inside the van alongside the assailants' weapons, \"to reach this place,\" a police spokesperson says. \"The police respect the women too much.\" Though the attack raises concerns about Kabul's vulnerability and security shortcomings as US forces start withdrawing from Afghanistan, US Ambassador Ryan Crocker downplayed it, calling it simply \"harassment.\" He continues, \"If this is the best they can do, I find their lack of ability and capacity and the ability of Afghan forces to respond to it, actually encouraging.\" Crocker tells the New York Times today that the Pakistan-based Haqqani group appeared to be behind the assault."}, {"generated_summaries": ["The largest living fish, whale sharks, may increasingly be using volcanic islands off the western coast of Europe as a new home as sea surface temperatures rise, researchers say.The scientists found a sharp rise in whale shark sightings in the exceptionally warm year of 2008, and the giant fish became regular visitors to the region afterward.For example, higher water temperatures around the southernmost Azores Island of Santa Maria were associated with more sightings of the fish.Observers also spotted the sharks more often in areas with underwater hills and mountains; these seafloor features coincide with large amounts of photosynthetic organisms that feed the creatures that the whale sharks eat.These findings are a window into what might happen as climate changes globally, the scientists said.\"Large marine animals such as the whale shark can change their oceanic distributions depending on regional conditions,\" Afonso said.In a new interview with TODAY, Chalipo's mom said that her invoice was just a lighthearted gag and she does not actually expect her son \u2014 who, statistically speaking, is probably making way less money than his parents did \u2014 to pay her the $39,000 she is owed.\"It was intended to be tongue-in-cheek, although obviously I was a little annoyed by him, as you can see with that thousand dollar itemized 'unappreciative' comment,\" she told TODAY. \"But he was never expected to pay it.."], "gt_summaries": "- A Reddit user living in Toronto better be kissing up to his momma for quite a while: The 23-year-old student, who goes by Chalipo on Reddit, recently got into an argument with his mom about how much it had cost her to support him over the last 13 months, reports ABC News.

Police say the 50-year-old, who has a developmental delay and functions at a child's level, has spent the last 30 years living in St. Catharines, around 80 miles from where he disappeared, CTV reports. From what investigators can piece together, Latulip took a bus to Niagara Falls in September 1986 and ended up in St. Catharines, where he suffered a head injury and \"effectively forgot who he was\" until this year, when he told a social worker he remembered. Before his disappearance, Latulip had attempted suicide at least once, leading to fears he may have killed himself. Police officer Duane Gingerich, who investigated the disappearance, tells the Guelph Mercury that he's thrilled that Latulip has turned up alive. \"I had hopes that he was out there somewhere,\" he says. \"For us as investigators, this is great, this is awesome. It's satisfying because most of these cases don't turn out this way. You expect the worst when a person is missing for that period of time.\" A DNA test confirmed Latulip's identity and police say a reunion with his mother, who moved to Ottawa years ago, is being arranged. In a 2014 interview, she told the Mercury she was still haunted by the disappearance. \"This is always at the back of my mind. Having an answer would mean closure,\" she said.

The Azores are currently fulfilling the needs of the animals, which, LiveScience notes, can be up to 41.5 feet long and weigh a whopping 47,000 pounds. The temperatures around the Azores, off western Europe, appear to be linked to higher amounts of a favorite whale shark food: chlorophyll-a. Researchers in the area came to their shark population conclusions by assessing 16 years of data from tuna fishermen who've spotted the animals. Indeed, so many sharks have headed there that the region, previously in the northernmost part of the sharks' territory, is experiencing a boom in tourists' \"whale shark watching.\" These tourists, it seems, needn't fear: Whale sharks are by no means ferocious, LiveScience points out.

Michael Avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch Viktor Vekselberg may have \"replenished the account\" in a series of payments in 2017 after the Daniels settlement, though Columbus Nova, a US affiliate of a Vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to Trump's personal lawyer, the Washington Post reports. The purpose of the company's payments is unclear. Sources tell CNN that Robert Mueller's investigators have already quizzed Vekselberg about the payments to Cohen's company. Records reviewed by the Times show that around $4.4 million flowed through the Essential Consultants account between its creation weeks before the 2016 election and January this year, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical firm Novartis, AT&T, and Korea Aerospace. AT&T confirmed the payments late Tuesday, saying Cohen's firm was among those it \"engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\" the AP reports. Cohen isn't a registered lobbyist, and while the unusual payments may not have broken any laws, Trump and his attorney \"have a lot of explaining to do,\" Avenatti said in a tweet Tuesday.\n\nAfter expanding the search to Vermont, authorities hunting escaped prisoners Richard Matt and David Sweat have descended on a village just a few miles from the prison. Police have closed a stretch of State Route 374 and ordered residents of Cadyville, NY, to stay inside and keep their exterior lights on, residents tell WPTZ. In other developments: Timothy Vail was the last man to escape from a New York prison, according to the New York Daily News, and he says he hopes Matt and Sweat can avoid capture. He tells the Daily News that he hopes they \"stay out of sight and don't commit any new crimes.\" Vail, who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1988, injured himself while escaping from the Elmira Correctional Facility in 2003 and was recaptured within two days after he and a fellow fugitive stole a van. Police officers who've dealt with Matt say he is the most evil criminal they've encountered, and he was trouble from a very early age, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reports. The former chief of police in North Tonawanda, near where Matt grew up, says he's around the same age as the 48-year-old and that long before Matt's first arrest, he had a \"fearsome\" reputation and was known for terrorizing other kids on the school bus. An officer in Tonawanda tells the paper that in 1986\u201411 years before his arrest for a gruesome local murder\u2014Matt broke out of a correctional facility and was recaptured a few days later. Early reports described the pair as among the first to escape in the Clinton Correctional Facility's long history, but dozens of men have made it out in various ways since the forbidding Dannemora, NY, institution opened in 1845, the New York Times reports. In 1860, a fraudster known as the \"Gay Deceiver\" put on civilian clothes, strolled out the gate, and wasn't recaptured for a year. A history professor tells the Times that the first escapes happened just weeks after the prison opened. The reform-minded warden decided not to punish the two men after they were recaptured, the professor says, but it wasn't long before a new warden installed a dungeon for solitary confinement, where punishments included waterboarding."}, {"generated_summaries": ["An American teenager has been rewarded for returning Chris Hemsworth's wallet, which the Australian actor lost while he was dining with his family in a \"rough\" area of Los Angeles.."], "gt_summaries": "- A disturbing video getting attention on social media shows a row of eight Chinese bank employees on a stage being told to \"get their butts ready\" then spanked\u2014hard\u2014in front of their colleagues for \"not exceeding themselves.\" The employees had been in a \"Breakthrough in Performance\" training class, and a man with a microphone asked them each to explain why they ranked lowest in the class, the South China Morning Post reports.

But he didn't count on Tristin Budzyn-Baker, who found the wallet. \"I looked up at my mom and was like, 'Ma, do you know who this is?' We found Thor's wallet,'\" Budzyn-Baker told Ellen. Budzyn-Baker wrote a letter to Hemsworth's management, asking only for tickets for his mom to see Hemsworth on Ellen's show. He got that and more, USA Today reports. \"I expected it was going to be empty, and all the cash was in there, so I want to give you the cash\u2014there's a little extra in there,\" Hemsworth told Budzyn-Baker during Monday's show, handing the teen a wad of cash.

The latter was the case in Canada last week when a man punched a cougar that had a death grip on his 80-pound husky's neck, reports Reuters. Will Gibb, a 31-year-old technician from Red Deer, had pulled up to a Tim Hortons for coffee and let his dogs Sasha and Mongo out of his truck for a quick run around the parking lot, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. When he heard Sasha yelping in pain seconds later, he \"went running\" to save her, he tells the CBC. But it wasn't until he \"punched it in the side of the head\" that he saw the animal was a cougar. (Sightings are common but attacks rare, says an RCMP deputy.) The cat ran into the woods, but the punch proved insufficient. As Gibb tried to pick up Sasha's twitching body, the apparently confused dog bit him and the cougar reemerged, so he had to throw punches with his right arm while trying to protect his dog and his hurt left arm. \"She was fighting for her life,\" Gibb says of Sasha, who ran to safety. When the cougar went for Mongo, Gibb grabbed a big stick and got in its way before chasing it off into the woods again. With a vet clinic just a block away, Sasha was tended to quickly, while local police found and killed the cougar. The vet says Sasha had to be sewn up in her chest and had deep bites around her neck, but she survived thanks to her owner.

They \"sit down on church steps, eat their food, and leave rubbish strewn on them,\" with no respect for \"our cultural heritage,\" Nardella tells the Guardian. He says city officials thought about handing out fines to such tourists, but they decided instead to get creative. The plan: Use water hoses to soak church steps. That way, if tourists sit down, \"they'll get wet,\" Nardella said in announcing the strategy Wednesday. Shortly after the announcement, the steps of both the Basilica of Santa Croce and the Chiesa di Santo Spirito were doused. In the future, this will be a daily occurrence, reports the Telegraph. \"Instead of imposing fines, we thought this measure was more elegant,\" Nardella tells the Guardian, adding other areas might eventually get a wash as well. While some social media users joked that a free shower might be nice in the heat of summer, others have accused city officials of being \"elitist\" in targeting tourists who choose not to eat in Florence's restaurants, per the Local.

Researchers studied genetic data on 2,082 people, about half of whom had used cannabis, Reuters reports; they focused on the number of schizophrenia-linked genes in the subjects. The experts found that those with a predisposition to the illness were more likely to use cannabis\u2014and to use more of it\u2014than were those without schizophrenia-linked genes, regardless of mental health history. In other words, says a researcher, the study suggests \"a pre-disposition to schizophrenia also increases your likelihood of cannabis use.\" The Verge explains the complexities of the possible relationship between schizophrenia and marijuana: In the 1960s, for instance, scientists thought that smoking marijuana could cause psychosis in most people; these days, researchers believe using the drug may spur schizophrenia in those who are predisposed to it. The new study effectively turns the idea around, suggesting that those who are predisposed to the illness may also be predisposed to using marijuana.

The tooth was a hopeful clue in a nearly century-old mystery\u2014one that still wouldn't be solved for years to come. The head (see it here) was discovered in 1915 in Deir el-Bersha, south of Cairo, in a room built for a governor named Djehutynakht and his wife 4,000 years ago. It had been looted by grave robbers, and the identity of the head\u2014was it Djehutynakht's or his wife's?\u2014remained unclear. A DNA test could provide the answer, but no mummy of that age had given up usable, reliable DNA, and \"the ancient DNA community had largely given up on the testing\" of such remains, per a report in the journal Genes. The molar was their best bet, and scientists tried and failed to get it to give up its DNA.

The worst of it took place in a three-hour span starting around midnight Saturday when 30 people were shot, reports the Sun-Times. Of those victims, 25 were injured in five mass shootings. Police say gang violence is mostly to blame, with shooters taking advantage of large gatherings in the summer weather to inflict the most casualties. \"If they shoot you, they don\u2019t even run,\u201d one man tells the Chicago Tribune. \"They just walk away, they ain\u2019t trying to run.\" A police spokesman says the extra police presence at the music festival did not play a role in the violence because officers working it were generally on their regular days off and on OT. The violence prompted Rudy Giuliani to enter the fray with a series of tweets backing Garry McCarthy, a former Chicago police chief who hopes to unseat Mayor Rahm Emanuel. \"MAKE CHICAGO SAFE AGAIN!\" tweeted Giuliani, who worked with McCarthy in New York when Giuliani was mayor. Giuliani called McCarthy a \"policing genius\" thanks to his work with the data-centric CompStat system, adding, \"Chicago murders are direct result of one party Democratic rule for decades.\" The Washington Post can't resist pointing out that Giuliani misspelled McCarthy's first name as \"Jerry\" and the current mayor's last name as \"Emmanuel,\" and that McCarthy is a Democrat himself.\n\nAfter Robin Williams' sudden death, the tributes are rolling in, with many recalling a comic genius grappling with private challenges.

And beyond that, \"his essential persona as an entertainer combined neediness and generosity, intelligence and kindness, in ways that were charming and often unexpectedly moving.\" Williams may have gotten his start long before Aladdin, but he gave a \"generous and humble\" gift to the millennial generation, writes Daniel D'Addario at Salon. \"Williams will be remembered for his edgy comedy and for dramatic turns, but for people my age, Williams was our childhood,\" from Mrs. Doubtfire to Jumanji to Flubber. In the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan recalls a moment when, facing an onslaught of photographers, Williams asked him\u2014in the voice of a fly from a 1950s sci-fi flick\u2014to \"help me, Ken.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles\u2014$15.99\u2014and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let\u2019s be clear.

The National Association of Theatre Owners plans to try it out in one state this year. Which night will be cheap night isn't yet clear. The move would run counter to theaters' current habit of raising prices each year\u2014a trend which has resulted in higher revenues despite lower ticket sales. Last year, for instance, the average ticket price was $8.13, up from $7.96 in 2012. Box-office sales, meanwhile, hit $10.9 billion, compared to $10.8 billion in 2012.

CDC officials tell the Washington Post that 35 patients in the US have been stricken with Candida auris, a fungus that can cause bloodstream, wound, and ear infections, with another 18 people harboring the microbe without becoming ill. Some strains of the pathogen don't respond to the three main classes of antifungal drugs, and based on the small number of cases health officials have had the chance to review, 60% of patients hit with C. auris have died (though the agency notes many of those patients had other serious medical issues they were contending with). The fungus is contagious and durable, especially in health care facilities, where it can stick around on furniture and other equipment for months. The first C. auris strain was reported in 2009 in a Japanese man, and it has since spread around the globe, including to Colombia, India, Israel, Kenya, Kuwait, Pakistan, South Korea, Venezuela, and the UK. The first US case was reported in 2013, and the CDC's latest report places 28 of the incidents in New York state, with other affected states including New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Illinois. CDC Acting Director Anne Schuchat said at a recent briefing that \"scary,\" \"difficult to combat\" drug-resistant microorganisms are on the rise, per the Post. Some good news is that C. auris hasn't morphed yet into new strains, and most people's chances of contracting it are very low, with it only affecting \"the sickest of the sick,\" says CDC infectious disease specialist Tom Chiller. Also encouraging: a recent study IDing an antifungal that may prove useful.

As expected with such a schedule, they suffer chronic sleep deprivation. They also work in hazardous conditions and face physical and verbal abuse from captains, who withhold their personal documents, the report notes, per CNNMoney. \"Sometimes, the net is too heavy, and workers get pulled into the water and just disappear,\" a Burmese worker says in the report. \"When someone dies, he gets thrown into the water.\" The revelations don't stop there.

Where did it all go wrong for the Wisconsin governor? Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders. Fundraising dried up as Donald Trump's rise pushed him to the sidelines, leaving him with a large organization but little support. His sudden departure from the race came after he failed to make an impression at the second debate and a CNN poll found his support at well below 1%. \"He was a terrible candidate, but he also got Trump-ed,\" a source tells Politico.

Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border. In his exit speech last night, Walker said he had been \"called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field.\" He urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to Trump could emerge, the Washington Post reports.

The paper adds it still has beefs with the Democratic Party and a wariness regarding Clinton, but that its endorsement comes because \"unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton has experience in actual governance, a record of service, and a willingness to delve into real policy.\" The paper cites how Clinton reached across the aisle in the Senate and wielded her authority as secretary of state to make \"tough calls\" about the Middle East and in the \"complex struggle against radical Islamic terrorism.\" The paper acknowledges Clinton is still dealing with controversy regarding her emails, the Clinton Foundation, and a general perception by many that she's not honest and trustworthy.

Some 152,000 of them had to find an alternate way to get to class in the freezing rain this morning, amid a school-bus drivers strike, reports the NY Daily News. Schools issued MetroCards to affected students so they could take public transportation, and parents who opt to pay for a taxi or drive their kids can fill out forms for reimbursement. But some worry that kids with special needs\u2014more than a third of the children affected\u2014will fall through the cracks, and parents of young students won't receive MetroCards allowing them to escort their kids until tomorrow. The strike, the first since the 1970s, could last for days or months, as no negotiations have yet been scheduled between the striking bus driver's union and city officials. The dispute centers around new contracts for certain bus routes that the city plans to bid out in an attempt to cut costs. The union called for a strike, fearing current drivers could wind up jobless when their contracts expire in June, reports NBC 4 New York. Protestors are forming picket lines at bus yards, and at least one driver says she plans to stay there for \"as long as it takes.\" Replacement drivers hired by the bus companies will be ready to take the wheel next week\u2014so long as they're willing to cross the lines.\n\nA tree beloved by Anne Frank is gone, toppled by a storm today in Amsterdam.

But Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya might convince you otherwise. Presented as a faux documentary, the film starring Margot Robbie has a 90% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: \"I, Tonya takes greater risks with the biopic genre than any other in recent memory, and it's remarkable how much of it lands upright. It's the triple axel of based-on-true-story movies,\" writes Andrew Lapin at NPR. Robbie \"magnificently\" embodies Harding with \"a childlike sincerity, a lost-soul cluelessness,\" he writes. This, and the film's chaotic mix of personas and styles, \"builds to a satisfying and illuminating portrait of a poor American girl who maybe never stood a chance.\" \"There's something genuinely electric about the narrative's headlong tumble into madness,\" coming from \"a script where the truth was irrefutably stranger than any fiction,\" writes Leah Greenblatt at Entertainment Weekly. She found the skating scenes \"thrilling.\" But \"Robbie is the real revelation,\" Greenblatt writes. \"She's a powerhouse: a scrappy, defiant subversion of the American dream. You won't just find yourself rooting for this crazy kid; you might even fall a little bit in love.\" It's \"a darkly satiric comedy with the tenor of a Coen brothers movie\" and \"earns the sort of high marks for creative interpretation that its protagonist complained eluded her,\" writes Brian Lowry at CNN. But he argues \"the sleight of hand used to realize the skating sequences is visually distracting in places.\" He also says Robbie \"struggles\" at the start to truly come across as just 15. And though she recovers to deliver \"a layered and unexpectedly sympathetic portrait,\" Allison Janney, playing Harding's mother, \"pretty nearly steals the show.\" Christy Lemire is effusive: Robbie gives \"the performance of a lifetime,\" conveying \"the requisite swagger of an athlete at the top of her sport\" as well as the \"low sense of self-worth buried underneath.\" As for the film itself, it highlights Harding's outsider status from the outset, which \"makes her story relatable beyond the insular world of figure skating,\" Lemire writes at RogerEbert.com. She concludes by calling I, Tonya a \"nearly flawless program\" and \"one of the year's best films.\"\n\nJohn Stumpf, the Wells Fargo CEO slammed for his \"gutless leadership\" by Sen.

The announcement comes as Wells Fargo is set to go before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. The board says it is launching an independent investigation into how millions of accounts were created without the permission of customers, the BBC reports. Wells Fargo was fined $185 million over the scandal and the Washington Post describes the board's cash clawback as \"by far the most aggressive and public effort\" since the 2008 financial crisis to punish bank chiefs for misconduct\u2014although Stumpf still has the estimated $161 million he received in bonuses over the five years the scam took place, and Tolstedt received $60 million over the same period.

The spate of headlines was kicked off by an official state health advisory warning that the drink, usually served in a copper mug, poses a health risk if the wrong kind of mug is used. For the uninitiated, a Moscow Mule has vodka, ginger beer, and lime, and thus is acidic, explains Live Science. The problem is, you're not supposed to serve acidic beverages in mugs with a copper interior because it raises the risk of copper leaching into the drink. Solution? A mug with a copper exterior is fine, but make sure the interior is made of stainless steel, nickel, or some other alternative. The advice isn't new, but the state felt compelled to issue the advisory given the \"recent popularity of Moscow Mules.\" (A cruise through Instagram proves the point.) Iowa's warning is based on an FDA advisory from a few years ago. Specifically, it says that drinks with a PH level of 6.0 or under should not be served in pure copper mugs, and the Mule falls into that category. For the record, so do fruit juices, vinegar, and wine, notes the Daily News. (Some might prefer a little food poisoning to this cocktail ingredient.)\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's husband, Prince Philip, will stop carrying out public engagements this fall, Buckingham Palace announced Thursday.

Hanks was serving on a jury in LA this week, but when a lawyer in the City Attorney's Office made the mistake of talking to the actor, the case had to be settled with a plea deal. The prosecuting attorney revealed the interaction Tuesday and asked for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct, CNN reports. Instead, yesterday, both sides agreed to a reduced charge. The defendant initially faced up to a year in jail on domestic assault charges; the reduced disturbing the peace charge carries with it just a $150 fine. So what did the lawyer approach Hanks about?

Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings\u2014until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance\u2014or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"\u2014so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says. (Read about the tech behind the slot machines here.)\n\nJesse Matthew, charged with the abduction of missing UVa student Hannah Graham, was found in Galveston, Texas, Wednesday on a \"beach out in the boonies,\" as one Texan put it.

Matthew is one of many to hole up on the spot (among others: famed French pirate Jean Lafitte, rumor has it), where some stay for months. \"We get lots of weird folks,\" says a local. \"It seems like a good place to seek refuge. It's kind of remote.\" More on the case from the Washington Post and the Daily Progress: Matthew initially said he was \"George Carr,\" but police discovered his true identity when they ran his car's plates. Authorities have searched the car, beach, and sand dunes. The case has brought to light another accusation against Matthew. An official has confirmed he was accused of raping a woman at Liberty University in 2002, but she didn't proceed with the case. He was a student there at the time. \"Basically, the woman was saying she hadn't consented and Matthew was saying she had,\" says an attorney with the Lynchburg Commonwealth Attorney's Office. Searchers have scoured much of Charlottesville, Va., and are moving on to surrounding farms and woodland.

The reduction is apparently meant to protest the independent US raid on bin Laden's compound, which has been criticized in Pakistan as violating that country's sovereignty, the AP reports. Pakistan earlier warned of \"disastrous consequences\" if the US carries out other, similar raids in the future. Despite the admitted shortcomings, Pakistan's army says the country's Inter-Services Intelligence agency gave initial information to the CIA. In its statement, the first since the raid, the army threatened that if the US carries out more raids like Sunday's, it will review its cooperation with Washington. The Washington Post notes that Pakistan's foreign minister also appeared to question whether the US raid was legal, citing UN Security Council resolutions and suggesting the raid may have breached international law.\n\nYou probably can already identify the contents of most of your photos, but this is still fun. A new website from Stephen Wolfram, whom you may know from the search tool WolframAlpha, lets you drag and drop any photo; it will then in theory identify what's in it. Right now, ImageIdentify manages some impressive feats, the Verge reports: For instance, it was able to tell that a picture of a cow was a black angus. On the other hand, it thought a cupcake was a bottle cap. The Wolfram Language team is happy to acknowledge the mistakes. In a blog post, Wolfram notes that \"somehow the errors seemed very understandable, and in a sense very human. It seemed as if what ImageIdentify was doing was successfully capturing some of the essence of the human process of identifying images.\" In the meantime, it does have some practical uses: At PC World, Jared Newman writes that \"using the site, I was able to figure the breed of dog that kept following my wife and I around on our honeymoon (miniature pinscher) and the exact type of flower from a hike in Los Angeles (larkspur).\" And we can expect ImageIdentify to get better at its job, since it keeps copies of the images you post and learns from them; its abilities come from the study of tens of millions of pictures, Wolfram says. You can also tell the site whether its analysis was correct. It's not the only such system, the Verge notes, pointing to efforts like Google Goggles.

Sofia Zago was brought to the hospital on Saturday with a high fever and quickly fell into a coma.

They uncovered what the CBC labels a \"dodo whodunit.\" Though scientists had assumed the dodo kept at Oxford University Museum of Natural History died of natural causes, inside its mummified skull were 20 to 30 \"metallic high-density particles\" that left no doubt how the male bird met its end: \"He was shot in the back of the head with a shotgun,\" Williams says, adding \"we could be looking at the first examples of lead shots ever used to hunt game birds.\" Now begins the search for the culprit: Museum director Paul Smith says a chemical analysis of the lead pellets will hopefully reveal \"what country the shot was made in so we could then determine who killed the dodo.\" The Oxford specimen\u2014the most complete dodo to be found and the only one to contain soft tissue and viable DNA\u2014was previously thought to be from a dodo displayed in London in 1638 before its natural death, per the Telegraph. \"Was it shot in the UK? More likely, was it shot in the Mauritius and then transferred to the UK? Was it shot for food on a ship?\" Williams wonders, per Live Science. The dodo was later acquired by King Charles II's gardener and passed to Oxford, where it is said to have inspired Alice in Wonderland author Lewis Carroll, reports the BBC.

The shootings took place at three homes Saturday night\u2014two in Brookhaven and one in Bogue Chitto\u2014about 70 miles south of Jackson, after authorities got a call about a domestic dispute, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation said. The dead included two boys, investigators said. Godbolt was listed in good condition at a hospital with a gunshot wound; authorities did not say how he was wounded. Bureau of Investigation spokesman Warren Strain said charges had yet to be filed and it was too soon to say what the motive was. Authorities gave no details on the relationship between Godbolt and the victims. However, Godbolt himself shed some light on what happened in a video interview with the newspaper as he sat with his hands cuffed behind his back on the side of a road. Godbolt said he was talking with his wife and in-laws when somebody called authorities. \"I was having a conversation with her stepdaddy and her mama and her, my wife, about me taking my children home,\" he said. \"Somebody called the officer, people that didn't even live at the house. That's what they do. They intervene.\" \"They cost him his life,\" he said, apparently referring to the deputy. \"I'm sorry.\" The stepfather-in-law, Vincent Mitchell, said in an interview that Godbolt's wife and their two children had been staying at his Bogue Chitto home for about three weeks after she left her husband."}, {"generated_summaries": ["President Barack Obama's convention speech ranks as the shortest acceptance speech by an incumbent in 36 years.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 * John Kerry: The Massachusetts senator started off slowly but he certainly amped it up.

At 38 minutes, it was the shortest acceptance speech from an incumbent since Gerald Ford in 1976, Politico notes.

Obama \"laid out no discernible second-term agenda of his own,\" and his attack on Romney's \"supposed plans to eradicate all of government while giving tax cuts to the wealthy\" was the speech's \"sole coherent message,\" he writes. Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post names his winners and losers of the convention, and puts Obama between the two categories. \"At times, it felt more like a State of the Union address than a convention acceptance speech. It was workmanlike more than inspirational,\" he writes. The speech wasn't in the same league as Bill Clinton's, \"but neither will it be remembered as a colossal flop.\" The speech was \"forceful, animated, and error-free\u2014but not among his most lustrous rhetorical moments,\" write Niall Stanage and Amie Parnes at the Hill. The speech \"highlighted Obama\u2019s accomplishments, drew broad outlines of what a second White House term would bring, and was jam-packed with stark, sometimes mocking, contrasts between his policies and those\" of Mitt Romney, but there wasn't a glimpse of the \"more elevated oratory that powered his historic journey to the Oval Office in 2008\" until the final minutes.\n\nA barista in Washington, DC, has unintentionally raised a philosophical quandary by rejecting the idea that the customer is always right.

The paper likes Harry and \"is NOT making any moral judgment\" about his behavior, it explains. It simply believes \"Sun readers have a right to see them.\" Why? Because the photos have sparked a debate about Harry's lifestyle, considering he officially represents Britain, and thus any Brits without Internet access could not fully take part in that conversation. \"There is a clear public interest in publishing the Harry pictures, in order for the debate around them to be fully informed.\" More on Harry: The prince was pictured hugging an also-naked woman \u2026 because he's so chivalrous. \"He hugged her to cover her up.

Although Justice Anthony Hayden described the toddler as \"a fighter, resilient, courageous and a warrior,\" he doesn't think further treatment will make any difference in Alfie's condition and that his parents should take this \"special opportunity\" to spend time with him, not waste it on what he sees as futile treatment and legal battles. Hayden also rejected claims by Alfie's father that the boy was doing \"significantly better\" after Alfie was said to have breathed without machinery for 20 hours after being taken off life support. \"The brain cannot regenerate itself and there is virtually nothing of his brain left,\" Hayden argued.

He's not so sure it wasn't a racially spurred incident and says the field marshal and the soccer club owe him an apology, reports WTLV. (Remember \"Permit Patty\"?)\n\nConservationists are expressing outrage after an official in Germany ordered hunters to shoot the first wild bison seen in the country in more than two centuries. Calling the killing a criminal offense, the World Wildlife Fund says it will file charges against the official who gave the order, the Local reports. \u201cAfter more than 250 years a wild bison had been spotted again in Germany and all the authorities could think to do is shoot it,\" says Chris Heinrich, a WWF board member. The bison was seen by the river Oder near the eastern town of Lebus on Wednesday. Thinking the beast was a threat to public safety, a local official sent a pair of hunters to take care of it. It was unclear if any of them knew the European bison is classed as a \"vulnerable\" species and on Germany\u2019s list of \"strongly protected animals.\" The victim was likely a bull that had wandered across the border from Poland from its home in a national park. While they may be the continent's largest land mammals, weighing up to 2,200 pounds, the bison are not considered dangerous. If they were, says the local environmental minister, then \"half of Poland, where the animal is a national symbol, would have to be declared a danger zone.\" Hunted to near extinction in Europe in the early 20th century, the bison are making a comeback thanks to conservationists, with more than 1,200 now roaming around Poland, per the Telegraph, which published a video showing bison fleeing, then standing up to, a pack of wolves. (The US bison is the country's first national mammal.)\n\nArchaeologists in Greece are nearly ready to enter what they say is the biggest ancient tomb ever unearthed in the country. The tomb at the ancient site of Amphipolis in the Macedonia region, around 65 miles northeast of Thessaloniki, dates from around 300 BC\u2014the time of Alexander the Great, though experts don't believe it belongs to the warrior-king, who died in what is now Iraq, the Telegraph reports. Two carved sphinxes flank the entrance to the tomb, which is surrounded by a 540-yard marble outer wall. \"It looks like the tomb of a prominent Macedonian of that era,\" a culture ministry official tells Reuters. Archaeologists have spent the last couple years excavating the ancient burial mound under which the tomb was found, and they plan to enter the tomb within the next two weeks, reports NBC, which adds that there is one clue to its possible occupant: Researchers believe a 16-foot stone lion unearthed in the area a century ago and associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, one of Alexander the Great's military commanders, once stood atop the tomb.

USA Today reports the five-time NBA championship winner was first stopped by cops in Newport Beach around 11pm for vehicle code violations before officers began a DUI investigation. According to reports, Rodman was given a breathalyzer test before being arrested and booked into Newport Beach Jail. The legal limit in California is .08, but police did not release Rodman's test results. TMZ reports the 56-year-old was cooperative and that he remained in custody for seven hours before officials determined he'd sobered up enough to go home. Rodman was previously arrested on DUI charges in 1999 and 2003. \"Alcoholism has been a struggle on and off for Dennis the past 15 years,\" a rep for Rodman told TMZ on Sunday. Rodman retired in 2000 after 14 seasons in the NBA. More recently, he's made headlines for his unlikely bond with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Just last month, the LA Times reported that Rodman wanted to arrange a diplomatic basketball game between North Korea and Guam, a US territory. \u201cThe people in Guam are all about it. They love it,\" he said while on what he called a \"humanitarian\" tour of Asia aimed at bridging the rift in US-DPRK relations. With President Trump and Kim Jong Un trading fiery rhetoric, Rodman used the occasion of his fifth and most recent North Korea visit to present a state official with a copy of Trump's The Art of the Deal in June.\n\nIf we're being honest, the selfie is pass\u00e9. Today's discerning Instagrammers require a new way to document their every waking moment. Enter the Nokia 8 and its \"bothie.\" Nokia's attempt to compete with Samsung and Apple in the high-end smartphone market hits stores in Europe in September. Wired reports the Nokia 8 is standard stuff for a high-end smartphone; it's got 64 gigs of storage, 4 gigs of RAM, a 5.3-inch screen, and so on. And the Verge came away fairly unimpressed by the phone, calling it \"average,\" especially compared to what Apple apparently has planned for its new phone. The one thing the Nokia 8 does have, and what it could live or die on, is the bothie. The bothie uses Dual Sight technology to let users take photos or videos using both the front and rear cameras at the same time, the Guardian explains. The resulting video or image shows whatever is in front of the user alongside the user's reaction to it. Those photos and videos can then be shared directly to Facebook or YouTube. Wired calls the bothie the Nokia 8's \"only truly unique feature,\" meaning the phone was made \"for the YouTubers and Instagrammers of the world.\" And they'll have to embrace the bothie if Nokia has any chance of competing with Apple and Samsung. Meanwhile, the future of the American bothie is unclear, as Nokia has not announced plans to bring the phone to the US.\n\nFrances Bean Cobain made her musical debut yesterday\u2014albeit in cameo form\u2014with the release of Evelyn Evelyn. \u201cShe\u2019s got a great voice,\u201d says Amanda Palmer, who put together the concept album with Jason Webley.

But the 49-year-old is back on the job, after 23 years behind bars for a crime he didn't commit. The Chicago Tribune reports Coleman, whose conviction for a 1994 rape and murder was overturned in November after DNA evidence cleared him, would often watch his former groundskeeping colleagues taking care of the rain-delay tarp on TV in prison, and once released, he talked fondly about his old role at the stadium. \"I'd wake up in the morning proud to go to work,\" he tells the Tribune. \"I loved it.\" When the White Sox got wind of his desire to return, they called him in for an interview, and to Coleman's delight he got the gig, which started Monday, per CBS News. The head groundskeeper greeted him with: \"I saved your spot for you. I knew you'd be back,\" per the Tribune. As for the White Sox, they said in a statement, \"We're grateful that after more than two decades, justice has been carried out for Nevest. It has been a long time, but we're thrilled that we have the opportunity to welcome him back to the White Sox family.\" Coleman, who kept his mind occupied in prison by reading the Game of Thrones and Harry Potter books, among others, is now looking forward to spending time with his kids (whom he left on the outside when they were babies) and grandkids and getting used to all the changes at the park. And he's done looking back at the past, per CBS Chicago. \"If I'm happy, everybody else will be happy,\" he says. \"I don't have time to be miserable, you know?\"\n\nWhen we want to be perceived as powerful\u2014think parents scolding misbehaving kids or shoppers haggling with car dealers\u2014we tend to focus not just on our words, but the way we deliver them. Researchers at San Diego State University report in the journal Psychological Science that when people want to portray themselves as powerful or authoritative, their voices go up in pitch, become more monotone, and exhibit more variation in loudness. What's more, listeners hear and identify these differences as powerful, reports Medical News Today. The researchers were inspired to study vocal volume and inflection because of the oft-told story of Margaret Thatcher's vocal coaching when she became prime minister of the UK, reports the Association for Psychological Science. \"It was quite well known that Thatcher had gone through extensive voice coaching to exude a more authoritative, powerful persona,\" one researcher says. \"Amazingly, power affected our participants\u2019 voices in almost the exact same way that Thatcher's voice changed after her vocal training,\" another says. (By this logic, these people are probably speaking pretty quietly.)\n\nFor 40 days and nights, Noah's ark was said to have housed all variety of creatures\u2014but probably not one like this, who just became the first of its kind to live past a similar 40-day mark, per National Geographic. Lucky the two-faced calf, who lives on a Campbellsville, Ky., farm, is the result of a rare genetic mutation that at first had owners Brandy and Stan McCubbin doing a double-take when she was born in mid-September. \"From a distance, I thought I had twins lying together,\" Stan told WDRB at the time. \"Then when I saw her, I was just completely blown away.\" The McCubbins' 5-year-old daughter named the calf after she heard her mom say the baby was lucky to alive. The BBC explains that two-headed animals like Lucky\u2014a condition called craniofacial duplication, or diprosopus\u2014 can be produced in a variety of ways: They can come from a single fertilized egg that never fully separates, be the result of a developmental anomaly in which the head keeps growing until it breaks into two new ones, or emerge when cells that set off head development somehow get moved to the wrong part of an animal's body. Lucky's two middle eyes don't work, she can only walk in circles, and she tends to fall down a lot. She also needs assistance when chowing down\u2014and both her mouths move when she's chewing\u2014but she seems healthy otherwise. \"It's something I've never seen before, and I think it's amazing,\" Stan tells WDRB.
