An emboldened Ukraine today said that it would not reopen ceasefire negotiations until the rebels had laid down their weapons entirely, the AP reports. The once undermanned and outgunned Ukrainian force is now noticeably better armed, using buses and pickup trucks alongside its armored vehicles to transport what the Telegraph describes as a \"motley mix\" of police, special forces, and militiamen. Ukraine says it has succeeded in sealing the Russian border, preventing troops and weapons from flowing to the rebels. But Vladimir Putin has been suspiciously silent, ignoring the separatists' increasingly urgent pleas for help, and many are speculating that he aims to cut his losses, having already taken the real prize of Crimea, the Wall Street Journal reports. Observers believe Moscow has ruled out any military intervention, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov struck a decidedly peaceful tone at a news conference, saying, \"A quick end to the bloodshed is in our common interest.\" But one US official cautioned against declaring victory. \"There is only one person who knows what Putin is planning,\" he said, \"and that is Putin.\"\n\nWeird news from the land of Charlie Sheen: The troubled actor has managed to irk a group of 9/11 truthers, which is now threatening to protest in front of his live shows.

NORWALK >> A judge on Friday ruled there was enough evidence to try an Antigua man accused of hiring a drug dealer to kill his wife at a La Mirada park in 1992.Morrad Ghonim sped out of the parking lot with his young bride bleeding to death in the passenger seat next to him..", "gt_summaries": "- On July 23, 1992, Morrad Ghonim watched his 17-year-old wife die. The couple had taken their 6-month-old son to Creek Park in La Mirada, Calif. Ghonim said he felt uncomfortable after a group of people called out at his wife and he wanted to leave, reports the Los Angeles Times. But as they made to drive off, a gunman approached the passenger door, demanded money, and murdered his wife. Now, 24 years later, a jury has decided who was responsible for Vicki Ghonim's death: then-19-year-old Morrad Ghonim. The 43-year-old, who was extradited from Antigua last year, was on Monday found guilty of first-degree murder. The man who pulled the trigger, however, was Leon Martinez. Police got to Martinez by way of grant money earmarked for cold cases, reports the Whittier Daily News. A DNA test of pants found near the scene led them in 2010 to Martinez, who said Ghonim hired him and even reached over his wife's body to hand him payment. A friend of Martinez's relayed meeting a man days before Vicki's death who said he and his child's mother\u2014a student at John Glenn High, as Vicki was\u2014were having issues and planned to separate. In late January, the Daily News painted a picture of a confident defense, given that in exchange for testifying, Martinez will not serve life without parole for the murder, but instead 28 years to life. \"This is a 20-year-old murder that comes down to the credibility of a convicted killer and an ex-wife who hates Mr. Ghonim ... and promised to send him to hell,\" said one of Ghonim's lawyers, noting that Ghonim's second wife talked to police. Ghonim could be handed life without parole at his Dec. 19 sentencing.\n\nThe man who co-founded Pixar and is seen as the creative force behind blockbusters such as the Toy Story and Cars franchises will soon be out of a job at Disney. John Lasseter, 61, has been on leave from parent company Disney since November after allegations of improper workplace behavior surfaced, including his propensity to wrap up everyone he meets in long bear hugs. Disney announced Friday that Lasseter\u2014who previously acknowledged and apologized for his \"missteps\"\u2014will shift into a vague consulting role through the end of the year and then depart for good, reports the New York Times. Disney execs were wrestling for months with whether to allow Lasseter to return, but Deadline reports on a \"gathering sense\" among employees that he would not have been welcome. Disney chief Bob Iger issued a statement that praised Lasseter for \"reinventing the animation business, taking breathtaking risks, and telling original, high quality stories that will last forever,\u201d and Lasseter issued one of his own thanking Disney and saying he's \"extremely proud\" of his work but that it's time to move on. Despite the positive public comments, the move amounts to what the Los Angeles Times describes as \"a dramatic unraveling of one of the most storied careers in animation.\" The story notes that hugs were just a part of the problem, with female employees at Pixar alleging that Lasseter and other senior execs turned a blind eye to a corporate culture rife with crude jokes and inappropriate touching.

Actress Patricia Arquette added: \"It doesn't matter how young or old, how beautiful or homely. Rapists rape. End of story.\" Lansbury has now responded to her critics. \"There is no excuse whatsoever for men to harass women in an abusive sexual manner,\" Entertainment Weekly quotes the 92-year-old Murder She Wrote star as saying. \"And, I am devastated that anyone should deem me capable of thinking otherwise.\" Lansbury says she's \"a strong supporter of women's rights\" and is \"troubled by how quickly and brutishly some have taken my comments out of context and attempted to blame my generation, my age, or my mindset, without having read the entirety of what I said.\" To which the AV Club quips: \"Welcome to the internet, Dame Angela.\""}, {"generated_summaries": "Brigham Young UniversityArchive-It Partner Since: Feb, 2013Organization Type: Colleges & UniversitiesOrganization URL: http://lib.byu.edu The L.

In the case from 2015, a 55-year-old Spanish woman died of multiple organ failure after two years of the treatment to relieve muscular contracture and stress. In bee-sting therapy, bees placed on a patient's body have their heads squeezed until they extend their stingers, the Telegraph reports. The idea is that the stings cause inflammation and lead to an anti-inflammatory response from the body. The unnamed woman started wheezing and having shortness of breath during one of her monthly treatments at a private clinic before losing consciousness. She died weeks later at the hospital. Researchers say severe anaphylactic shock caused a \"massive watershed stroke and permanent coma,\" as well as the multiple organ failure. \"The risks of undergoing apitherapy may exceed the presumed benefits, leading us to conclude that this practice is both unsafe and unadvisable,\" one researcher says.

Caylee Anthony was last seen June 16, but was not reported missing for a full month.

One of the United Nations' chief investigators says evidence is building that sarin gas was used in the Syrian conflict\u2014but by rebels, not Bashar al-Assad's regime. \"Our investigators have been in neighboring countries interviewing victims, doctors, and field hospitals\" and \"there are strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin gas,\" said Carla Del Ponte, a member of a panel probing alleged Syrian war crimes, Reuters reports. \"This was use on the part of the opposition, the rebels, not by the government authorities,\" she adds. The war crimes inquiry commission Del Ponte is involved with is separate from the main UN probe into chemical weapons use in Syria. Each side accused the other of using chemical weapons during fighting in Aleppo in March, while Britain and France say they have evidence that regime forces used nerve agents in attacks on rebels. In other developments: Israeli airstrikes on targets inside Syria in recent days have killed at least 42 government soldiers, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights tells the AP. Israel today emphasized that the strikes were not meant to aid rebels, Reuters adds, but rather to block weapons from Hezbollah. The Israeli move renewed debate on whether the US should use airstrikes against the Assad regime, the New York Times reports. John McCain, who yesterday blasted President Obama's \"red line\" as being \"written in disappearing ink,\" said the strikes show that Syria's air defense system may not be much of an obstacle. Opposition activists say rebel forces shot down a military helicopter last night, killing eight government troops, the AP reports.

Martin Bailey says Van Gogh didn't take a razor to his ear because of an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, though the two did quarrel that day in 1888, the Guardian reports. Instead, Van Gogh cut his ear off because he had learned that his brother, Theo, was going to get married, Bailey says. He says the struggling artist feared that the marriage would end his close relationship with his brother\u2014and that it would cause Theo to cut off the financial support Van Gogh relied on. Bailey says that Van Gogh didn't learn of the engagement while he was recovering in hospital, as previously thought, but in a letter that was delivered to him in Provence just hours before the self-mutilation. \"Had Van Gogh been elated by the engagement, it is virtually inconceivable that he would have sliced off part of his ear a few hours after receiving Theo\u2019s news, whatever other difficulties he was facing,\" Bailey writes in new book Studio of the South, per the Telegraph.

The actor \"bought him drink after drink after drink and when my son was drunk, Spacey made his move and sexually assaulted him,\" said Heather Unruh at a press conference Wednesday. She says Spacey stuck his hand down her son's pants and onto his genitals, and tried to convince him to go to a party where they could continue to drink, USA Today reports. A bystander asked the teen if he was OK and the teen said no, at which point the woman urged the teen to flee and he took her advice, Unruh said. Unruh, who appeared with an attorney, says her son filed a police report last week and handed over evidence; she says a criminal investigation has been opened but the Nantucket Police Department has not confirmed that. The attorney with Unruh noted that her son's accusations are \"well within\" both the civil and criminal statutes of limitations. USA Today has a list of the 14 people so far accusing Spacey of sexual assault or harassment. Meanwhile Jon Bernthal, who worked with Spacey on Baby Driver, told a SiriusXM radio show Tuesday that he lost respect for Spacey while working on the film. \"I thought he was a bit of a bully,\" Bernthal said, per People. \"I didn\u2019t really care for the way he was behaving toward some of the other people on set.\"\n\nWillie and Carol Fowler were prepared to lose their deposits. Their daughter canceled her Georgia wedding with just 40 days' notice, and the venue, food, and entertainment were already paid for. Then Willie had \"a vision,\" his wife tells ABC News. \"I was in the process of canceling out the venue and he said, 'No, what we'll do is donate it to Hosea Feed the Hungry.'\" Their daughter had volunteered for the organization, which helps homeless people in the Atlanta area, when she was younger. And that's how, on Sept. 15, the Fowler Family Celebration of Love was born. Two hundred guests were bused to Villa Christina for a four-course meal complete with coconut shrimp and salmon (the 50 kids in attendance got chicken fingers). The family hopes to get sponsors and make it an annual event, Carol tells WBUR. A rep for Hosea Feed the Hungry said the nonprofit initially thought the Fowlers were pulling their leg: \"It's a very creme de la creme wedding venue, so to say that you're going to host 200 homeless individuals at Villa Christina\u2014it sounds like a prank call.\" The Fowlers' daughter attended the event, and her dad says it was a \"bittersweet but rewarding\" experience; her mom tells Today Tamara found it \"surreal but incredibly rewarding.\" Carol has this advice: \"If you have canceled an event, do not walk away. Pick up the phone and call your favorite charity and offer it to them. We're regular, working people and anybody can do this. This is not star stuff.\" (In Boston, a homeless man who did a very good deed is being handsomely rewarded.)\n\nAs she traveled through Brazil's northern region on a mission to kayak the 4,000-mile length of the Amazon River, Emma Kelty repeated a warning from a Peruvian guide in tongue-and-cheek fashion. \"I will have my boat stolen and I will be killed too,\" she tweeted. \"Nice.\" It appears the latter part of that warning has come true. On Sept. 13\u2014a day after remarking that she'd come across dozens of men in motor boats armed with arrows and rifles near Coari, an area known to be frequented by river pirates and drug traffickers\u2014Kelty sent out a distress signal and then went silent, reports the Guardian.

Elizabeth Warren went after Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf during a Senate hearing Tuesday with the kind of heat she usually reserves for Donald Trump tweetstorms. \"You should resign ... and you should be criminally investigated,\" NPR quotes Warren as saying. Stumpf was in front of the Senate banking committee after Wells Fargo employees created millions of fake accounts for customers without their permission in order to charge them extra fees. Stumpf said he was \"deeply sorry\" for what happened, New Republic reports. But\u2014according to CNBC\u2014he maintained it wasn't a \"scam\"\u2014Warren's word\u2014but a \"way of deepening relationships\" with customers. Warren accused Stumpf of \"gutless leadership\" for passing responsibility for what happened away from himself and other senior executives while blaming \"thousands of $12-an-hour employees who were just trying to meet cross-sell quotas that made you rich.\" The employees' cross-selling scheme was at least partially responsible for Wells Fargo stock going up, making Stumpf's shares alone gain $200 million in value. While more than 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were fired, none of the senior executives are losing their jobs. Warren said the only way Wall Street will be reformed is if CEOs like Stumpf start seeing jail time.

But last month's budget contained language that forces the government to plan for restarting these paper mailings. Ridiculous? Not according to a group called Consumers for Paper Options, which lobbied for that change and has since 2010 been \"advocating for access to paper-based services and information,\" as the group puts it. But though the group says it's a \"coalition of individuals and organizations,\" it's actually a product of the paper industry, the Washington Post reports: It was established by the Envelope Manufacturers Association and gets funding from the top paper-industry trade group. The Treasury expects to save $1 billion over a decade following its 2013 move to largely paperless communications, noting that processing a paper check costs $1.25, which is $1.16 cents more than the cost of an electronic payment. (It hasn't stopped paper mailings to the elderly and people with \"mental impairments,\" the Post notes.) But \"if there are Americans who can't use an iPhone to navigate the Internet, there ought to be an option for them,\" says a rep for Consumers for Paper Options, noting that a quarter of the US lacks Internet access. He also cites a study that says 73% of adults don't believe they should have to deal with the government online. That study was run by the group. A recent op-ed in Roll Call signed by a pair of congressmen also pushed for paper; it turns out Consumers for Paper Options was involved in that piece, too.

The Wisconsin State Journal reports on the unidentified 32-year-old man at the center of it all, showing up Tuesday at a Madison police station to turn himself in for what he'd intended to do: take pictures up women's skirts by using a shoe camera. The Washington Post notes it's not exactly clear what a \"shoe camera\" is, but the man apparently was able to attach some kind of photographic device to his shoe and was testing it at home when the battery exploded, injuring his foot, Officer David Dexheimer tells the Journal. After getting treatment for the minor burns he received from the mini-blast, the man confessed his unsavory intentions to a clergyman, who encouraged him to turn himself in to police, Dexheimer says. There's a Wisconsin law on the books that outlaws anyone from purposely installing a device to photograph or otherwise record under a person's clothes without that person's consent, but the man in this case caught a lucky break: Per Madison Police Chief Mike Koval's daily \"significant calls\" blog, \"the subject was counseled on his actions and released from the scene as no illicit video had been taken.\" Koval notes there is an ongoing investigation, however.

Polls ahead of Election Day showed Conservatives locked in a tight race with the opposition Labour Party, raising the possibility of days or weeks of negotiations to form a government. Instead, the party won an outright majority, taking 326 of 650 seats.

Two big ones: Expect to start reading the word \"Brexit\" much more often, with Cameron having vowed to hold a 2017 referendum on whether the UK should remain a part of the EU.

CNN presents the possibility, noting that the Scottish National Party's victory was a staggering one, with it taking 56 out of the 59 UK parliamentary seats in Scotland. CNN points to \"rumblings in the British press\" that such an SNP victory could spur yet another referendum, this one in 2016, on a split. The view from Michael Wolff: \"It might be argued that the Cameron government's campaign last year to defeat the referendum for Scottish independence helped propel the popularity of the SNP, which in turn undermined the Labour Party's traditional strength in Scotland, thereby helping to [ensure] the Tory victory,\" he writes in USA Today.

The New York Times reports those videos, shot by overheard aircraft on March 4, 2002, may show Air Force Technical Sergeant John Chapman fighting al-Qaeda militants and killing two while alone on a mountaintop in Afghanistan. What's so shocking about the footage is not just the bravery. It's that Chapman was supposed to be dead. He was originally there with members of SEAL Team 6, providing support as their radioman. In the midst of a fierce and disastrous operation, Senior Chief Petty Officer Britt Slabinski determined the men needed to get off the mountain. Slabinski couldn't verify the wounded Chapman was dead, but he was nearly certain. So a \"dead\" Chapman was left behind. The Air Force now suspects Chapman was alive for roughly another hour and tried to provide cover for a helicopter carrying Army Ranger reinforcements (three Rangers were among seven Americans to die that day; some say blame rests at the SEALs' feet). The conclusion comes thanks to technology that assigns those on the ground a pixel signature that can be tracked even when ground cover blocks a man from view. The Air Force secretary wants Chapman given the Medal of Honor; SEAL Team 6 has no issue with that, but hasn't taken a stance on whether Chapman was alive. Slabinski is outwardly skeptical, and suggests the Air Force would welcome a Medal of Honor, which it hasn't seen one of its own get since Vietnam. But a fresh look at Chapman's autopsy may provide further proof he was alive.

In the speech to Al Sharpton's National Action Network, Mediaite reports that Holder went off script with these lines: \u201cThe last five years have been defined by significant strides and by lasting reforms even in the face, even in the face of unprecedented, unwarranted, ugly and divisive adversity. If you don\u2019t believe that, you look at the way\u2014forget about me, forget about me. You look at the way the attorney general of the United States was treated yesterday by a House committee\u2014has nothing to do with me, forget that. What attorney general has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment? What president has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment?\u201d Holder was apparently referring to a heated exchange he had with Republican Louie Gohmert of Texas as he testified before the House Judiciary Committee. Real Clear Politics has the transcript: Gohmert: \u201cI realize that contempt is not a big deal to our attorney general. But it is important that we have proper oversight ...\" Holder: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go there, buddy. You don\u2019t want to go there, OK?\u201d Gohmert: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go there? ... About the contempt?\u201d Holder: \"No. You should not assume that that is not a big deal to me. I think it was inappropriate. I think it was unjust. But never think that that was not a big deal to me. Don\u2019t ever think that.\u201d The Washington Post notes that Holder also muttered, \"Good luck with your asparagus\" to Gohmert, a reference to yet another nasty exchange between the two last year. Back then, an annoyed Gohmert apparently misspoke, asserting that \"the attorney general will not cast aspersions on my asparagus.\u201d Gohmert wasn't Holder's only critic at yesterday's hearing.

According to the Sacramento Bee, police in Sacramento were responding Sunday night to reports of a man breaking car windows when they found Clark in his backyard. Police say the 22-year-old man at first fled before approaching officers while holding an \"object\" that he \"extended in front of him.\" Police say the officers thought it was a gun and, fearing for their safety, opened fire on Clark. Police initially said the object turned out to be a \"tool bar\" of some kind only to later revise that: Clark was apparently holding only a cellphone. No gun was found at the scene. \u201cI know there could have been another way.

A sampling of what the pundits are saying: In New York, Jonathan Chait argues that \"the United States has polarized into stable voting blocs, and the Democratic bloc is a bit larger and growing at a faster rate.\" That should put Clinton in the White House, though it's not guaranteed. \"She cannot promise her supporters a dramatic change or new possibilities,\" Chait notes. \"Her worry is that ennui sets in among the base and yields a small electorate more like the kind that shows up at the midterms, which is an electorate Republicans can win.\" But at Salon, a former aide for Bill Clinton is concerned about his wife's strategy so far. \"Republicans love to paint Democrats as elitists. It\u2019s how the first two Bushes took out Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry\u2014and how Jeb plans to take out Hillary,\" Bill Curry writes.

Officers briefly confiscated a handgun from Zimmerman, who was acquitted last year in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, but returned it to him, shook hands, and sent him on his way.

Instead, teams can now simply signal the ump that a walk is in the works, and the runner can immediately saunter over to first. This change could shave 14.3 seconds off of each game, per estimates by the Wall Street Journal. The Washington Post notes \"not everyone is thrilled\" with the change, including those who enjoy watching what happens when intentional-walk pitches go wild or batters go for them anyway.

The far-right and conspiracy theorist publications found in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's apartment appear to have been supplied by an elderly man befriended by the brothers through their mother's job as a home health aide, the Wall Street Journal finds. A lawyer for the family of Donald Larking, a 67-year-old who suffered brain damage when he was shot in a robbery 40 years ago, says Larking was obsessed with conspiracy theories and shared publications with the brothers that questioned the Holocaust and accused the US or Israeli governments of being behind 9/11 and the Newtown school shooting. Larking also supplied the brothers with copies of a white supremacist newspaper published in Alabama. He became so close to Tamerlan that he converted to Islam and began attending the local mosque with him, says the lawyer, who stresses that the shooting badly impaired the elderly man's \"awareness of the realities of the world\" and his ability to make decisions, the AP reports. Larking, who still attends the mosque, has sunk into \"depression and anger\" since the Boston Marathon bombing and believes his friends were the victims of another conspiracy, the lawyer says.\n\nA 21-year-old Baltimore County man died in the hospital three days after being repeatedly punched by officers responding to his 911 call, the Guardian reports.

Essentially, \"it's a very basic form of word generation,\" researcher Andy Russell tells the BBC. The team started out by listening to chestnut-crowned babbler birds. Rather than sing, they produce \"discrete calls made up of smaller, acoustically distinct individual sounds,\" an expert says in a press release. Two sounds, identified as \"A\" and \"B,\" kept getting repeated. For example, the birds used an \"AB\" call to tell other birds where they were while in flight (listening birds would look to the sky), while a \"BAB\" call told chicks it was feeding time (listening birds would look at nests). Rearranging the sounds of the flight call to produce the latter call showed no alteration in the birds' behavior, and vice versa, proving the individual sounds were in fact the same. \"Although the two babbler bird calls are structurally very similar, they are produced in totally different behavioral contexts and listening birds are capable of picking up on this,\" a researcher explains. Russell adds, per the Christian Science Monitor, the babblers may communicate this way because it's easier to swap existing sounds than make up new ones. What's perhaps most fascinating is that researchers believe the birds' \"B\" sound differentiates the meaning of the call. In other words, it's the \"c\" that discerns the words \"cat\" and \"at\" in the English language. Such distinguishing elements are called phonemes, and this basic example \"might help us understand how the ability to generate new meaning initially evolved in humans,\" an expert says. \"It could be that when phoneme structuring first got off the ground in our hominid ancestors, this is the form it initially took.\" Russell says the ability likely exists in other animals.

", "gt_summaries": "- With a $140 million budget and an opening weekend take of only $24 million, The BFG is poised to be Steven Spielberg's biggest flop in 37 years, Rolling Stone reports. That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book\u2014Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.\u201d\n\nGolf may be \"a good walk, spoiled,\" but at least it doesn't spoil your life expectancy. In fact, a new study finds that heavy cardio sports like cycling and rowing do nothing to help you live longer than playing golf or cricket, reports the Wall Street Journal. Researchers looked at mortality rates in 9,889 Olympic athletes who completed from 1896 to 1936 in 43 types of sports, and surprisingly found that those who competed in intense activities did not live any longer than those who curled, shot guns, played cricket, or golfed. \"Engaging in cycling and rowing (high cardiovascular intensity) had no added survival benefit compared with playing golf or cricket (low cardiovascular intensity),\" says the study. One theory is that intensive exercise over the long-term also leads to injuries and damage that balance out the benefits of such exercise. \"Over time, this will result in an accumulation of damage, which can be explained as a form of aging,\" says a study author.

John Podesta told CNN's State of the Union that Comey should have reviewed the information more thoroughly before making the decision public. Now, Podesta says, Comey should explain why \"he took this unprecedented step, particularly when he said himself in the letter to the Hill that these (emails) may not even be significant.\" The candidate herself kept up the attack on Comey, notes CNN, telling a crowd on Saturday that \"it's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election. In fact, it's not just strange, it's unprecedented and it's deeply troubling because voters deserve to get full and complete facts.\" Elsewhere: Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says Comey was between a rock and a hard place, and could have been accused of meddling with the election if he hadn't made the disclosure. Meanwhile, Team Trump is walking back its previous criticism of the FBI's handling of the investigation into Clinton's email. Tim Kaine says Comey needs to tell the public if he hasn't yet reviewed any of the emails considered \"pertinent\" to the investigation, and says that as far as the campaign knows, Comey \"knows nothing about the content of these emails.\" He calls it a \"distraction\" but says the Clinton campaign will \"power forward\" during the last 10 days. Mike Pence says the scandal shows that Clinton is \"just a risky choice in this election.\" He adds that Trump has \"made it clear we'll have the resources we need,\" and praises his \"incredible generosity.\" Clinton's close relationship with top aide Huma Abedin is being put to the test, reports the New York Times.

Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: At Vox, Ezra Klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an \"insane\" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the White House and the other the Senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? Reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty.

A witness says that after the boy fell 15 feet into in the enclosure, the gorilla seemed protective at first, but he became agitated as visitors screaming and started dragging the boy through a moat. A witness tells CNN that to get into the enclosure when his mother was distracted, the boy had to \"climb under something, through some bushes and then into the moat.\" He was released from a hospital on Saturday night and his parents issued a statement thanking the zoo and saying the boy is \"doing just fine,\" the Cincinnati Enquirer reports. \"We know that this was a very difficult decision for them, and that they are grieving the loss of their gorilla,\" they said.

In her first major appearance since Fox News, Palin slammed Obama time and again: \"Mr. President, we admit it, you won\u2014now step away from the teleprompter, and do your job!\" she said. She also dinged him on his golfing, his canceling of White House tours, and his proposal to broaden background checks for gun buyers. \"Dandy idea, Mr. President\u2014should've started with yours!\" Her talk received the most raucous and frequent ovations of the entire conference, the Guardian reports. She saved some of her folksy (or is it kitschy?) ire for the GOP, calling on the party to embrace a populist vision: \"Now is the time to furlough the consultants, and tune out the pollsters, send the focus groups home, and toss the political scripts,\" she said. And she speared new conservative super PACs designed to weed out more conservative candidates for more electable ones. Her talk had humor, too: She sipped a Big Gulp in a clear jab at New York's anti-soda campaign, and tossed off a line regarding her Christmas gift for husband Todd: \"He's got the rifle, I've got the rack.\" (Business Insider runs down the most \"awesome\" lines of Palin's speech.)\n\nGeorge W.

Bill Clinton also weighed in: \"I congratulate the president, the National Security team and the members of our armed forces on bringing Osama bin Laden to justice after more than a decade of murderous al-Qaeda attacks.\" Mike Huckabee was more succinct, crowing: \"Welcome to hell, bin Laden\" in his statement. Gordon Felt, the president of the Families of Flight 93, noted: \"It cannot ease our pain, or bring back our loved ones.

And while West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin had hoped it would be \"good news\" about jobs or the opioid crisis, it appears instead that the state's Democratic Gov. Jim Justice will reveal he's switching parties. According to Politico, no one in the Democratic Party was warned about Justice's plans. \u201cObviously we're pissed. I mean let's face it, we put a lot of effort in the 2015 election to elect this man as governor,\u201d a Democratic operative in West Virginia says. Democrats had held the governorship in West Virginia since 2001. While Democrats weren't given notice of Justice's switch, they probably shouldn't be surprised. Justice only joined the Democratic Party in 2015 to run for governor. He had been a registered Independent and Republican prior to that and even donated to the Republican Governors' Association a few years before his run as a Democrat. He's also friends with the Trump family and Sen. Mitch McConnell. Plus, the ever-more conservative West Virginia is a hotbed of Trump support.

The Telegraph resurfaces the remarkable story of Hessy Taft (born Hessy Levinsons), a now 80-year-old who in 1935, at just six months, was taken by her mother to a Berlin photographer to have her baby photo taken. Months later, Pauline Levinsons spied her daughter's photo on the cover of the Nazi magazine Sonne ins Hause. Worried their Jewish identity would surface as a result, she hurried back to Hans Ballin, who explained to her that he \"wanted to make the Nazis ridiculous\"\u2014and so the photographer intentionally entered the young Hessy into a contest looking for the most beautiful Aryan baby, one thought to be judged by Joseph Goebbels himself. The truth of the baby's identity never came to light, though Hessy was kept out of public sight by her parents, who feared she'd be recognized. A short time later the family fled Germany for Latvia, then Paris, Cuba, and finally the United States. Haaretz points out that Taft's story isn't an untold one: In fact, it's published on the US Holocaust Memorial Museum website. But it's getting a fresh look after Taft recently gave Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial a copy of the magazine cover. \"I feel a little revenge,\" the Telegraph quotes her as saying. \"Something like satisfaction.\" (In other Nazi news: Was Hitler a billionaire tax dodger?)\n\nA top fundraiser for President Trump has resigned from the Republican National Committee following a report that he paid $1.6 million to a Playboy playmate he had an affair with. Elliott Broidy told RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel Friday that he was resigning immediately, an RNC official familiar with the discussion tells the AP. The resignation comes after the Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen helped negotiate a non-disclosure agreement between Broidy and the model last year. The unidentified playmate elected to have an abortion after discovering she was pregnant. \u201cIt is unfortunate that this personal matter between two consenting adults is the subject of national discussion just because of Michael Cohen\u2019s involvement,\u201d Broidy said in a statement. Broidy, who is based in Los Angeles, had been deputy national finance chairman for the RNC, reports the Washington Post. Under the deal negotiated by Cohen between the married Broidy and the Playmate, the woman agreed to never discuss the relationship or she would have to forfeit the money. Cohen reportedly struck the deal in late 2017, about a year after paying porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 not to talk about her alleged affair with Trump. Broidy says Cohen approached him about the matter after the Playmate's attorney contacted Cohen. In the current campaign cycle, Broidy and his wife have donated more than $600,000 to the RNC and GOP campaign committees, per the Post.

He says his security team and the administration \"place me on the plane where they think [it's] best from a safety perspective.\" He was speaking days after the Washington Post reported that Pruitt, whose predecessors mostly flew coach, has racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in first-class and military jet travel costs, including $90,000 during a busy stretch in early June. Pruitt's government-funded travel is being reviewed by the EPA's internal watchdog, which says the results of its investigation should be released by the summer, the AP reports. Earlier this week, EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox claimed Pruitt had a \"blanket waiver\" allowing him to choose first class whenever he travels, but he retracted the statement after Politico pointed out that federal rules require a waiver for every taxpayer-funded first-class trip when it's for security reasons. Wilcox, whose earlier statement was criticized by both Democrats and Republicans, now says Pruitt \"submits a waiver to fly in either first or business class\" for every trip he makes.

The fight is between a spam-fighting group, Spamhaus, and a web-hosting company, Cyberbunker, but it has grown to the point that it's affecting the entire Internet and its infrastructure. Millions of users are experiencing delays while trying to reach websites or while using services like Netflix, and experts fear that if the attacks continue to grow in power, people may not be able to access things like email or online banking. It all started when Spamhaus, which publishes a blacklist that email providers use to weed out spam, put Cyberbunker on its list of spammers. Cyberbunker retaliated, but its attack on Spamhaus ended up having a much larger impact. One architect at a digital content provider likened it to, as the New York Times puts it, using a machine gun in an effort to assassinate one person. The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks \"are essentially like nuclear bombs\" that exploit the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS), says an exec at a group that tried to defend against the attacks and ended up becoming a target. \"It's so easy to cause so much damage.\" And, notes the architect, this is \"the largest publicly announced DDoS attack in the history of the Internet.\" Cyberbunker says Spamhaus is a vigilante group \"abusing [its] influence,\" but the architect notes that Cyberbunker is \"just mad\" that it got caught spamming. One security researcher says the only way to stop the attack is to arrest the people responsible.

Though the topic seems destined for the courts, the FCC's decision \"is going to be a benchmark,\" a researcher tells USA Today. The board is expected to approve chairman Tom Wheeler's guidelines to regulate the Internet like a utility, as President Obama suggested. His proposal also labels broadband providers as \"common carriers\" under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, which means the FCC could prohibit paid prioritization for \"fast lanes,\" NBC News reports. What does that mean for you? \"All this ruling means is that there will be FCC jurisdiction to examine practices and hear complaints,\" a legal professor explains. He bats down claims that this is \"an all-or-nothing decision that will transform the Internet,\" suggesting much is still to be determined. \"Your broadband will still cost the same amount as it did before.\" Essentially Wheeler's rules would mean Internet service providers must treat all traffic equally, which is why Netflix\u2014which claims almost 35% of peak traffic in the US\u2014supports the move. It can't be charged more for the bandwidth it uses. Companies like Etsy, Kickstarter, Tumblr, and Vimeo support rules similar to Wheeler's. In the past, so did Google. But nearly a decade after Google and Facebook first pushed for new rules, the search giant has urged the FCC to draft rules boosting investment in broadband Internet networks, as have net neutrality opponents AT&T and Comcast, the Wall Street Journal reports. An expert predicts the \"public utility-style regulations\" will \"create a tremendous amount of chaos\" for cable and Internet companies, particularly when it comes to addressing congestion. They would have to ensure their practices of freeing up bandwidth are \"reasonable,\" NPR reports. The rules also include what's called \"zero-rating,\" which is when an app or group of apps\u2014for example T-Mobile's Music Freedom plan\u2014isn't counted against a user's data cap. Sounds like a bonus, right? \"That distorts competition,\" says one expert. Republicans generally consider Wheeler's rules a government power grab. Congress could respond with legislation that undercuts Wheeler's guidelines, but Obama would likely veto.\n\nA cool, spaceship-like catamaran dropped anchor in Monaco yesterday after completing the first-ever round-the-world trip by a solar-powered vessel, the LA Times reports.

But what truly elevates the story is that the store's owner, an 89-year-old widow, just wasn't having it, reports USA Today. Miyo Koba of Moses Lake tells KREM-TV that she refused the robber's demand to open the register and instead threatened him with scissors. When he pushed her away and she fell, she spotted a golf club. \"I ... tried to swing this club at him and I tried to hit his head a couple times but I couldn't reach it,\u201d she says. She then started bashing him in the legs, rattling him enough that he fled with the register. Or tried to anyway.

Four members of the Wagner family were arrested Tuesday, and authorities say a custody dispute played a role in the murders, the AP reports. Edward \"Jake\" Wagner, now 26, was the ex-boyfriend of Hanna Rhoden, 19, who was killed while lying in bed with her 4-day-old baby girl. Wagner was not the newborn's father, but shared custody of another daughter, Sophia, now 5, with Rhoden. Sophia was not with her mother when she was murdered; the newborn as well as two of her young cousins who were present were not hurt. (This chart shows how all the victims were related.) Also arrested, per Cincinnati.com: Wagner's parents George \"Billy\" Wagner III, 47, and Angela Wagner, 48, and his brother George Wagner IV, 27. All four have been charged with eight counts of aggravated murder and also face a slew of other charges. The mothers of both elder Wagners were also arrested and accused of forging custody documents in an alleged cover-up of the crimes. Citing a \"fixation\" and \"obsession\" the Wagner family allegedly had with the custody situation, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said Tuesday the situation is \"the most bizarre story I've ever seen. It's just amazing.\" Authorities say the Wagners knew the Rhodens well and spent months studying their routines and the layouts of their homes. But the Wagners have long denied involvement and insisted they were close friends with the Rhodens; they moved to Alaska after the killings due, they said, to intense speculation over their possible involvement in the case. \"Sophia is getting older,\" Jake Wagner (who also set up a GoFundMe for custody-related legal bills in the wake of the massacre) said at the time, so they moved \"so she wouldn\u2019t hear it.\" They were arrested, however, in Ohio and Kentucky.

That much was clear at a Singapore press conference Tuesday, which took place after the president's meeting with Kim Jong Un and in which he touched upon the potential of North Korea's coastline. \"They have great beaches,\" Trump noted, per the Washington Examiner. \"You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean.\" And that spectacular view got him to thinking: \"Wouldn't that make a great condo? Instead of doing that you could have the best hotels in the world right there.

Things have gone downhill from there. But amid poverty and heroin woes, the city of 21,000 has \"turned for the worst,\" Jessica Sayre tells the Washington Post. Her 26-year-old sister, Tiffany, a sex worker battling a drug problem, went missing from a local motel on May 11. Her naked body was found wrapped in a sheet in a drainage pipe on Saturday, making her the fourth woman to turn up dead near Chillicothe's waterways in the last year. At least two more women have vanished, leading some to fear a serial killer is on the loose. \"I don't want to come out and say 'yes, we have a serial killer,'\" says an officer, but he admits it's possible. The location of the women's bodies isn't the only evidence linking the cases. Most of the victims had drug issues and some were prostitutes; some even knew each other, reports the Post, which rounded up coverage from the Columbus Dispatch and Huffington Post.

Researchers have presented a small study suggesting for the first time that air pollutants can make their way from a pregnant woman's lungs to her placenta, reports the Guardian. Because the placenta allows nutrients and oxygen to flow from the woman's blood stream to her fetus, that means it could similarly allow pollutants into the womb as well, per CNN. \"Our evidence suggests that this is indeed possible,\" says Norrice Liu, a pediatrician who led the research at Queen Mary University in London. \"We also know that the particles do not need to get into the baby's body to have an adverse effect, because if they have an effect on the placenta, this will have a direct impact on the fetus.\" The study, presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Paris, was indeed small, involving just five women. But researchers found \"black sooty\" particles, believed to be carbon, in the placentas of each one, says another of the researchers, Lisa Miyashita. Further analysis is in the works to confirm, but the results mirror similar ones in animals. Given previous research laying out the potential dangers that air pollution can cause to babies, the scientists say the study should factor into the advice given to pregnant women, even if it's as simple as wearing a mask or avoiding especially busy roads when out and about. The good news: All five of the women gave birth to healthy babies. (Air pollution might be the world's greatest killer.)\n\nThe Southern Avenger rides alone once more.

The researchers say the rate of ice loss has tripled over the last decade and the melting ice sheets are now pushing up sea levels around the world by around a half-millimeter every year, reports the BBC. Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"\u2014and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they\u2019re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that\u2019s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it\u2019s the area that we\u2019re most worried about, because it\u2019s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried. That doesn't mean we should be desperate,\" says study co-author Isabella Velicogna of the University of California Irvine, per the AP. \"Things are happening. They are happening faster than we expected.\"\n\nCoach will spend $2.4 billion for Kate Spade, tying together two premier brands in the luxury goods sector in a bid to snare younger shoppers. Noting that crucial demographic, Coach CEO Victor Luis says in a company release Monday that Kate Spade has a \"strong awareness among consumers, especially millennials.\" Coach will pay $18.50 per share of Kate Spade, a 9% premium to its Friday closing price of $16.97. It follows another recent millennial-minded deal on Coach's part: engaging Selena Gomez (and, it likely hopes, her 120 million Instagram fans) in a deal that will put her in Coach ads and across its social media, reports CNBC. But the brand isn't just going younger, it's going luxe-er, reports the AP: Coach has made an aggressive push to polish its image as a purveyor of opulence, ending many of the promotions it had used to ramp up sales. To power future growth, it's begun to build an empire of luxury brands. In 2015, Coach acquired the high-end footwear company Stuart Weitzman. Last month the company hired Joshua Schulman, the president of Neiman Marcus's Bergdorf Goodman division, and put him in the newly created position as president and CEO of the Coach brand.

The fixes aren't exactly high-tech: North Korean soldiers were seen digging a big trench in the border area where the soldier first drove and then ran to freedom, reports Reuters. They also planted trees, apparently to prevent vehicles from getting through in the future. Finally, North Korea also seems to have replaced all of its border security guards, reports the Yonhap news agency, which surmises that any officers involved are in for serious punishment.

Oh faces a long recuperation, having been shot at least five times. One bullet decimated his colon.

That feat became the subject of a medical drama. Lee, blind in one eye, also served as the inspiration for a character in a second drama called Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim, which was released last year and gave him certifiable celeb status. The Post uses the terms \"heartthrob\" and \"McDreamy\" in the profile. Next for Oh: The surgeon, taking note of Oh's \"jarhead\" haircut, jokingly suggested that Oh eventually join the South Korean military: \"He smiled and said that he would never ever go back to the military system again.\" When he's stronger, Oh will be debriefed. Then he'll get help with housing, education, and job training from the South Korean government, reports the Guardian.\n\nMore bad news for President Obama on ObamaCare today: The House passed legislation widely seen as undermining the health-care law, and 39 Democrats joined Republicans in favor, reports the Washington Post.

The Rabbs' fringe-limbed tree frog wasn't even discovered until 2005 when scientists were attempting to rescue specimens of any amphibian they could before a deadly chytrid fungal infection hit Panama. According to National Geographic, Toughie made it out of Panama, but it's estimated that the chytrid fungus killed up to 85% of all amphibians left behind in his natural habitat. He had lived in isolation at the Garden since 2008. A cause of death is unknown, but Toughie was believed to be at least 12 years old. In his final years, Toughie became a \"symbol of the extinction crisis.\" His photo was projected onto St. Peter's Basilica, and he was visited by film directors and race car drivers. \"A lot of people were moved to tears when they saw him,\" a photographer who worked with Toughie says. \"When you have the very last of something it's a special deal.\u201d While some scientists are holding out hope for the Rabbs' tree frog, it's likely Toughie was the last, Scientific American reports. His species hasn't been seen in the wild since 2007. It's rare for humans to actually witness an extinction when it happens and not just learn about it years later. (For the first time, bees have been put on the endangered species list.)\n\nIf, someday, bedbugs are no longer a cause for concern, remember to thank Regine Gries. She's a biologist in British Columbia who was willing to tolerate 180,000 bites as a host for the creatures so that her team could study them. \"I calmed myself down thinking when human beings were still living in caves, they were probably bitten by bedbugs, by fleas, by mice and who knows what,\" she tells the Canadian Press via CTV. \"So I think humans can endure this, and I'm lucky enough that I have no side effects, that I just can handle it.\" It seems her work has paid off. The researchers, including Gries' husband, found a histamine molecule that, to the bugs, indicates a \"safe space,\" the Press reports; once the bugs find it, they stick around. The researchers lured them to the trap using a pheromone blend and components from the bedbugs' own feces; the histamine then keeps them there. The cost of the chemicals? Less than a dime per trap. \"The biggest challenge in dealing with bedbugs is to detect the infestation at an early stage,\" Gries' husband tells Simon Fraser University News. \"This trap will help landlords, tenants, and pest-control professionals determine whether premises have a bedbug problem, so that they can treat it quickly.\" The trap should be on the market next year, CBC reports. That's particularly good news for Chicago, which was reported earlier this year to be America's worst city for bedbugs.

Police say the 50-year-old, who has a developmental delay and functions at a child's level, has spent the last 30 years living in St. Catharines, around 80 miles from where he disappeared, CTV reports. From what investigators can piece together, Latulip took a bus to Niagara Falls in September 1986 and ended up in St. Catharines, where he suffered a head injury and \"effectively forgot who he was\" until this year, when he told a social worker he remembered. Before his disappearance, Latulip had attempted suicide at least once, leading to fears he may have killed himself. Police officer Duane Gingerich, who investigated the disappearance, tells the Guelph Mercury that he's thrilled that Latulip has turned up alive. \"I had hopes that he was out there somewhere,\" he says. \"For us as investigators, this is great, this is awesome. It's satisfying because most of these cases don't turn out this way. You expect the worst when a person is missing for that period of time.\" A DNA test confirmed Latulip's identity and police say a reunion with his mother, who moved to Ottawa years ago, is being arranged. In a 2014 interview, she told the Mercury she was still haunted by the disappearance. \"This is always at the back of my mind. Having an answer would mean closure,\" she said. (A California hospital recently identified the man it had called \"Garage 66\" for 16 years.)\n\nThose hoping to avoid the world's biggest sharks would do well to stay away from Portugal's Azore Islands. That's where whale sharks\u2014the biggest fish in the sea\u2014are making a new home, likely due to climate change, a study finds. The creatures have a very specific set of temperatures they can tolerate, ranging from 78.8 degrees to 86 degrees Fahrenheit, Discovery notes. The Azores are currently fulfilling the needs of the animals, which, LiveScience notes, can be up to 41.5 feet long and weigh a whopping 47,000 pounds. The temperatures around the Azores, off western Europe, appear to be linked to higher amounts of a favorite whale shark food: chlorophyll-a. Researchers in the area came to their shark population conclusions by assessing 16 years of data from tuna fishermen who've spotted the animals. Indeed, so many sharks have headed there that the region, previously in the northernmost part of the sharks' territory, is experiencing a boom in tourists' \"whale shark watching.\" These tourists, it seems, needn't fear: Whale sharks are by no means ferocious, LiveScience points out.

New satellite photos show that Camp 25, thought to house about 5,000 of the 200,000 people believed to be held in North Korea's gulags, has grown steadily over the past decade, reports the Washington Post. Its perimeter grew 37% between just 2009 and 2010, according to the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, which says new buildings, guard posts, and fields have been added. Experts are unsure whether the expansion of Camp 25 signals an overall growth in political prisoners in North Korea or a move to accommodate existing prisoners as other camps are downsized. \"It appears that North Korea's vast system of unlawful imprisonment may be undergoing an alteration involving the consolidation of some of its political prison camps, and the expansion of others,\" said the executive director of the committee, according to Yonhap News."}, {"generated_summaries": "Investigators were reviewing surveillance video from a gas station near the Clinton Correctional Facility on Thursday night after the escape of two convicted killers over the weekend, Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said in an interview with CNN.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Real-time updates from reporters at the scene \ufffd \ufffd \ud835\udd97\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd9c\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd9e\ud835\udd96\ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd92\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd84\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd80\ud835\udd89\ud835\udd81\ud835\udd82\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8f\ud835\uddae\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd8c\ud835\udd93\ud835\uddaa\ud835\udda5\ud835\uddaf\ud835\udda8\ud835\udd9d\ud835\uddab\ud835\udda6 In court documents obtained Friday afternoon by Los Gatos Patch at the Santa Clara County Superior Court in San Jose, three attorneys with the Los Angeles-based law firm of Zuber & Taillieu LLP, said they are seeking the injunction to prevent Pinto-Walsh from disclosing information in breach of a confidentiality agreement she signed Feb. 25, 2011.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The company\u2019s confirmation came after Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, circulated on Twitter a document purporting to show a detailed accounting of wire transfers made to Essential Consultants, a company established by Cohen in October 2016..

According to financial records reviewed by the New York Times and NBC News, a company linked to a Russian oligarch targeted by US sanctions deposited around $500,000 into an account controlled by Essential Consultants, the shell company Cohen used to pay hush money to Daniels before the 2016 election. Michael Avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch Viktor Vekselberg may have \"replenished the account\" in a series of payments in 2017 after the Daniels settlement, though Columbus Nova, a US affiliate of a Vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to Trump's personal lawyer, the Washington Post reports. The purpose of the company's payments is unclear. Sources tell CNN that Robert Mueller's investigators have already quizzed Vekselberg about the payments to Cohen's company. Records reviewed by the Times show that around $4.4 million flowed through the Essential Consultants account between its creation weeks before the 2016 election and January this year, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical firm Novartis, AT&T, and Korea Aerospace. AT&T confirmed the payments late Tuesday, saying Cohen's firm was among those it \"engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\" the AP reports.

Police have closed a stretch of State Route 374 and ordered residents of Cadyville, NY, to stay inside and keep their exterior lights on, residents tell WPTZ. In other developments: Timothy Vail was the last man to escape from a New York prison, according to the New York Daily News, and he says he hopes Matt and Sweat can avoid capture. He tells the Daily News that he hopes they \"stay out of sight and don't commit any new crimes.\" Vail, who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1988, injured himself while escaping from the Elmira Correctional Facility in 2003 and was recaptured within two days after he and a fellow fugitive stole a van. Police officers who've dealt with Matt say he is the most evil criminal they've encountered, and he was trouble from a very early age, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reports. The former chief of police in North Tonawanda, near where Matt grew up, says he's around the same age as the 48-year-old and that long before Matt's first arrest, he had a \"fearsome\" reputation and was known for terrorizing other kids on the school bus. An officer in Tonawanda tells the paper that in 1986\u201411 years before his arrest for a gruesome local murder\u2014Matt broke out of a correctional facility and was recaptured a few days later.

In 1860, a fraudster known as the \"Gay Deceiver\" put on civilian clothes, strolled out the gate, and wasn't recaptured for a year. A history professor tells the Times that the first escapes happened just weeks after the prison opened.

The latter was the case in Canada last week when a man punched a cougar that had a death grip on his 80-pound husky's neck, reports Reuters. Will Gibb, a 31-year-old technician from Red Deer, had pulled up to a Tim Hortons for coffee and let his dogs Sasha and Mongo out of his truck for a quick run around the parking lot, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. When he heard Sasha yelping in pain seconds later, he \"went running\" to save her, he tells the CBC. But it wasn't until he \"punched it in the side of the head\" that he saw the animal was a cougar. (Sightings are common but attacks rare, says an RCMP deputy.) The cat ran into the woods, but the punch proved insufficient. As Gibb tried to pick up Sasha's twitching body, the apparently confused dog bit him and the cougar reemerged, so he had to throw punches with his right arm while trying to protect his dog and his hurt left arm. \"She was fighting for her life,\" Gibb says of Sasha, who ran to safety. When the cougar went for Mongo, Gibb grabbed a big stick and got in its way before chasing it off into the woods again. With a vet clinic just a block away, Sasha was tended to quickly, while local police found and killed the cougar. The vet says Sasha had to be sewn up in her chest and had deep bites around her neck, but she survived thanks to her owner.

He says city officials thought about handing out fines to such tourists, but they decided instead to get creative. The plan: Use water hoses to soak church steps. That way, if tourists sit down, \"they'll get wet,\" Nardella said in announcing the strategy Wednesday. Shortly after the announcement, the steps of both the Basilica of Santa Croce and the Chiesa di Santo Spirito were doused. In the future, this will be a daily occurrence, reports the Telegraph. \"Instead of imposing fines, we thought this measure was more elegant,\" Nardella tells the Guardian, adding other areas might eventually get a wash as well.

Researchers studied genetic data on 2,082 people, about half of whom had used cannabis, Reuters reports; they focused on the number of schizophrenia-linked genes in the subjects. The experts found that those with a predisposition to the illness were more likely to use cannabis\u2014and to use more of it\u2014than were those without schizophrenia-linked genes, regardless of mental health history. In other words, says a researcher, the study suggests \"a pre-disposition to schizophrenia also increases your likelihood of cannabis use.\" The Verge explains the complexities of the possible relationship between schizophrenia and marijuana: In the 1960s, for instance, scientists thought that smoking marijuana could cause psychosis in most people; these days, researchers believe using the drug may spur schizophrenia in those who are predisposed to it. The new study effectively turns the idea around, suggesting that those who are predisposed to the illness may also be predisposed to using marijuana.

Asking for a friend.\" The not-so-formal condition came to prominence in 2013 with a \"Bitchy Resting Face\" PSA by Funny or Die. Now, behavioral researchers Jason Rogers and Abbe Macbeth with Noldus Information Technology have used science to uncover why some people's resting faces are expressionless while those of others are considered angry and judgmental, the Washington Post reports. The pair used software called FaceReader, which maps 500 points on the human face and assigns expressions based on the emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, contempt, and \"neutral.\" When the researchers plugged in faces of famous RBF faces, the software lit up. \"Something in the person's face is relaying greater-than-trace amounts of contempt, but they don't intend that to be the case,\" Macbeth tells CBS News. That includes signals, Rogers tells the Post, such as \"one side of the lip pulled back slightly, the eyes squinting a little.\" One key point: The researchers found that the condition afflicts men and women equally. \"This means that classifying RBF as a female-dominant expression of bitchiness is actually quite wrong, and probably a reflection of societal expectations of women,\" observes the post at New York. (The Stir amplifies the point that men are affected, too, with a gallery of Kanye West RBF photos.)

The tooth was a hopeful clue in a nearly century-old mystery\u2014one that still wouldn't be solved for years to come. The head (see it here) was discovered in 1915 in Deir el-Bersha, south of Cairo, in a room built for a governor named Djehutynakht and his wife 4,000 years ago. It had been looted by grave robbers, and the identity of the head\u2014was it Djehutynakht's or his wife's?\u2014remained unclear. A DNA test could provide the answer, but no mummy of that age had given up usable, reliable DNA, and \"the ancient DNA community had largely given up on the testing\" of such remains, per a report in the journal Genes. The molar was their best bet, and scientists tried and failed to get it to give up its DNA. Then, in 2016, the tooth made its way to the FBI's Dr. Odile Loreille, a forensic scientist with a long history of working with old and ancient DNA; the New York Times reports she has identified Korean War victims, a 2-year-old who died on the Titanic, and the remains of two children of Russian Tsar Nicholas II. She managed to retrieve a tiny bit of powder\u2014just 0.004 ounces, per LiveScience\u2014from the tooth's core, and the ratio of chromosomes it contained proved it was male DNA: Governor Djehutynakht.

McArdle cites a post at KCET that explains what's going on: Supermarkets use chickens that are about to hit their sell-by expiration date for those rotisseries. In fact, they do it not just with chicken but with many of the offerings in the prepared-food department. Underhanded? No, writes McArdle. It's actually kind of brilliant.

When the raccoon finally stopped moving, she yanked out her finger and raced the three-quarters of a mile home. Two days later, the state confirmed the animal was infected with rabies. Borch got rabies shots, and an animal control officer adds an unpleasant footnote: The infected raccoon may not be alone. \"Not to scare people,\" Heidi Blood tells the News, but \"when there\u2019s one, there\u2019s typically another.\" (Normally nocturnal like raccoons, a crazed beaver attacked a woman paddle-boarder.)\n\nAccused kidnapper Ariel Castro has had 648 new counts added to his indictment, bringing the grand total to 977.

Weinstein, Streep writes, distributed movies she made with other people, and he \"needed me much more than I needed him and he made sure I didn't know.\" She adds that she has been hoping to speak to McGowan to express her \"deep respect for her and others' bravery in exposing the monsters among us.\" She says a legal defense fund is being assembled \"to bring down the bastards, and help victims fight this scourge within.\" In a now-deleted tweet, McGowan called Streep a hypocrite for \"happily working\" with the \"Pig Monster.\" She has not publicly responded to Streep's statement, though she tweeted Monday that she is sorry about suggesting celebrity protesters should wear Marchesa, the fashion line co-founded by Weinstein's estranged wife, Entertainment Tonight reports.\n\nWhile authorities say some of the victims of Ohio's \"execution-style\" killings died in their sleep, others may have put up a fight. Autopsies show some members of the Rhoden family had soft tissue bruising, suggesting they resisted their killer or killers, the Pike County Medical Examiner said Tuesday, per NBC News. A 911 caller who reported \"blood all over the house\" noted it looked like someone had \"beat the hell out of\" at least one victim. The autopsies confirmed all eight victims\u2014three women, four men, and a 16-year-old boy\u2014were fatally shot; one victim was shot once, one was shot twice, and the remaining victims were shot three or more times, including one person who had nine wounds. Authorities have yet to present a motive, though marijuana-growing operations were found at three of the four crime scenes. Sources say 200 plants recovered were worth about $500,000, reports CBS News. Birds were also found in \"small, segregated cages,\" which is \"consistent with cockfighting,\" says a rep for the Ohio attorney general, per NBC New York.

Instead, most of the attention is focused on the shooting violence that occurred elsewhere in the city, leaving more than 60 injured and 10 dead between Friday evening and Monday morning, reports WLS-TV. The worst of it took place in a three-hour span starting around midnight Saturday when 30 people were shot, reports the Sun-Times. Of those victims, 25 were injured in five mass shootings. Police say gang violence is mostly to blame, with shooters taking advantage of large gatherings in the summer weather to inflict the most casualties. \"If they shoot you, they don\u2019t even run,\u201d one man tells the Chicago Tribune. \"They just walk away, they ain\u2019t trying to run.\" A police spokesman says the extra police presence at the music festival did not play a role in the violence because officers working it were generally on their regular days off and on OT. The violence prompted Rudy Giuliani to enter the fray with a series of tweets backing Garry McCarthy, a former Chicago police chief who hopes to unseat Mayor Rahm Emanuel. \"MAKE CHICAGO SAFE AGAIN!\" tweeted Giuliani, who worked with McCarthy in New York when Giuliani was mayor. Giuliani called McCarthy a \"policing genius\" thanks to his work with the data-centric CompStat system, adding, \"Chicago murders are direct result of one party Democratic rule for decades.\" The Washington Post can't resist pointing out that Giuliani misspelled McCarthy's first name as \"Jerry\" and the current mayor's last name as \"Emmanuel,\" and that McCarthy is a Democrat himself.\n\nAfter Robin Williams' sudden death, the tributes are rolling in, with many recalling a comic genius grappling with private challenges. A sampling: When it comes to comedy, \"there wasn't a faster brain on the planet,\" writes Tony Hicks in the Contra Costa Times. We'll be hearing \"a litany of tributes about one of the great comedians who ever lived. Much of it will be some of the same adjectives used when any great performer dies\u2014especially before their time. But in Williams' case, most of it will be true.\" Early in his career, \"it was clear that Mr. Williams was one of the most explosively, exhaustingly, prodigiously verbal comedians who ever lived,\" AO Scott writes in the New York Times. And beyond that, \"his essential persona as an entertainer combined neediness and generosity, intelligence and kindness, in ways that were charming and often unexpectedly moving.\" Williams may have gotten his start long before Aladdin, but he gave a \"generous and humble\" gift to the millennial generation, writes Daniel D'Addario at Salon. \"Williams will be remembered for his edgy comedy and for dramatic turns, but for people my age, Williams was our childhood,\" from Mrs. Doubtfire to Jumanji to Flubber. In the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan recalls a moment when, facing an onslaught of photographers, Williams asked him\u2014in the voice of a fly from a 1950s sci-fi flick\u2014to \"help me, Ken. Help me.\" The experience stuck with him and seems particularly resonant today, he writes.\n\n\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles\u2014$15.99\u2014and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let\u2019s be clear. Soda taxes don\u2019t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue\u2014they drive it outside city limits. They don\u2019t help ease inequality\u2014they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Jean Johnson, grandmother of 31-year-old University of Minnesota medical student Ashley Hasti, tells the Star Tribune that the couple married in 2011 and split up around a year later, but they didn't get a divorce because Hasti couldn't afford one. Her body was found in her St. Paul home after cops at UCLA found a note from Sarkar asking them to \"check on my cat\" and giving his Minnesota address. Police found her name on a list in Sarkar's apartment and realized she could be in danger. Johnson says her granddaughter was a \"kind, beautiful, giggly girl\" and she doesn't know if there was any tension between her and Sarkar. LAPD Chief Charlie Beck says that Sarkar drove from Minnesota to Los Angeles and was probably in town for a \"couple of days\" before killing UCLA professor William Klug and shooting himself in Klug's office, the Los Angeles Times reports. The chief says Sarkar's car hasn't been found yet and it's not known whether he committed other crimes between Minnesota and California. Beck says investigators believe Sarkar, who made online postings accusing former mentor Klug of stealing his work, had planned to kill another UCLA professor but couldn't find him. That professor \"is fine\" and was aware Sarkar had issues with him, Beck says. On Thursday night, hundreds of students and faculty members gathered at UCLA to mourn Klug, known as a kind and dedicated professor who did his best to help students, including Sarkar, the AP reports. \"Bill was so much more than my soul mate,\" his wife, Mary Elise Klug, said in a statement. \"I will miss him every day for the rest of my life.\"\n\nPerhaps you expected bad reviews. After all, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is a mockumentary about a ridiculous Bieber-like rapper whose star is fading. But you're in for a nice surprise. Critics are raving about this spoof on celebrity culture, starring Andy Samberg and a sea of music-industry celebs. Here's what they're saying: It has all the makings of an \"easy-to-watch and enjoyable film. But Popstar is smarter than that,\" writes Anne T. Donahue at the Globe and Mail. \"It's a legitimate look at celebrity culture delivered in a way that's as funny as it is thought-provoking.\" Yes, there are dick jokes\u2014which are \"great\"\u2014but it effectively \"holds a magnifying glass up to the culture that we've all had a hand in creating.\" Fans of the Lonely Island, the name given to the comedy trio of Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone, are in for a \"nonstop party time,\" writes Peter Travers at Rolling Stone. The flick isn't just funny\u2014it's \"insanely funny\" and comes \"with a surprising amount of heart,\" he says, noting \"everyone from Bieber to Kanye gets ribbed in this hilarious mockumentary.\" It's \"a pitch-perfect take satirizing modern-day pop stardom\" and \"front and center, carrying the film, is Samberg in what is easily the most winning film performance of his career,\" writes Richard Roeper at the Chicago Sun-Times. \"It's funny because it gets it RIGHT without ever being too mean-spirited. Even the jokes referencing Anne Frank and Osama bin Laden are good-natured and almost sweet. Almost.\" Ty Burr, however, gives it a 6 or 7 out of 10. He enjoyed the \"sneaky wit of its take on celebrity culture\" and the \"patented Lonely Island music numbers,\" but he found Popstar to be \"genial, silly, and instantly forgettable,\" he writes at the Boston Globe.

Last year, US movie theaters sold 1.34 billion tickets, down 1.5% from the year before. And ticket sales dropped 11% between 2004 and 2013, the Motion Picture Association of America reported yesterday. To combat the trend, theaters are mulling a coordinated move: They may drop ticket prices on one weeknight a week, the Wall Street Journal reports. The National Association of Theatre Owners plans to try it out in one state this year. Which night will be cheap night isn't yet clear. The move would run counter to theaters' current habit of raising prices each year\u2014a trend which has resulted in higher revenues despite lower ticket sales. Last year, for instance, the average ticket price was $8.13, up from $7.96 in 2012. Box-office sales, meanwhile, hit $10.9 billion, compared to $10.8 billion in 2012. The cheap-day system \"has worked for years in Latin America and Canada,\" says theater owners association head John Fithian, per Deadline.

Jordan Landon was trapped by her seatbelt from about 10pm Friday until her Sunday night rescue, reports the Sun Journal. \"She ate Pop Tarts and Gatorade while she waited for help,\" says a sergeant with the NC Highway Patrol. Her father, Douglas, 39, died from his injuries. \"He was curled up in a ball with his arm right across his chest and his other arm pushed out across Jordan. He was trying to hold her and trying to keep her protected,\" says a family friend. Though alcohol is not currently suspected as a contributing factor, police recovered the speedometer, which was stuck at 110mph, reports ABC News. The car \"ran off the road to the right and into a steep ditch bank. The car went airborne and was inverted as it hit a cluster of trees,\" the sergeant explained. A passerby happened to notice the 1995 Chevrolet Monte Carlo while out walking. Police initially believed Jordan was dead, until she managed to make a sound. The story's unbelievably bizarre twist: WCTI reports that Jordan's mother set out on Saturday to look for the pair\u2014and crashed her own car 100 feet from where her daughter was pinned.

Turnout is everything: If it\u2019s high, that\u2019s probably a good sign for Romney. If it\u2019s low, it\u2019s a good sign for Paul and/or Santorum\u2014depending on where it\u2019s concentrated. Bad weather is thought to favor Paul\u2019s band of enthusiastic supporters. Location, location, location: Romney\u2019s support is strongest in eastern Iowa, Santorum should fare well in the northwest, and Paul is hoping for turnout in college towns such as Ames. Politico highlights 10 counties to watch here. The battle for fourth: If either Newt Gingrich or Rick Perry can pull out a closer-than-expected fourth, they might be able to stay in the race. Last-minute campaigning: Romney held rallies in four cities yesterday, his most since 2008. Paul held forth in a hotel full of journalists in Des Moines, hoping to grab media buzz. And Santorum appeared with the cast of 19 Kids and Counting, the TLC reality show beloved by Iowa homeschoolers. Some intriguing numbers: Paul\u2019s favorability has fallen 21 points in the past week. Only 76% of Santorum\u2019s supporters say they\u2019ll definitely caucus for him.

Initially, just the less sensitive footage was released, including video of Bieber stumbling a bit during a sobriety test and randomly doing push-ups in his jail cell. The five as-yet-unreleased clips will be out within a few days (TMZ offers up some TMI, noting that police are having a hard time blurring Bieber's genitals because they move too much in the video).

CDC officials tell the Washington Post that 35 patients in the US have been stricken with Candida auris, a fungus that can cause bloodstream, wound, and ear infections, with another 18 people harboring the microbe without becoming ill. Some strains of the pathogen don't respond to the three main classes of antifungal drugs, and based on the small number of cases health officials have had the chance to review, 60% of patients hit with C. auris have died (though the agency notes many of those patients had other serious medical issues they were contending with). The fungus is contagious and durable, especially in health care facilities, where it can stick around on furniture and other equipment for months. The first C. auris strain was reported in 2009 in a Japanese man, and it has since spread around the globe, including to Colombia, India, Israel, Kenya, Kuwait, Pakistan, South Korea, Venezuela, and the UK. The first US case was reported in 2013, and the CDC's latest report places 28 of the incidents in New York state, with other affected states including New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Illinois. CDC Acting Director Anne Schuchat said at a recent briefing that \"scary,\" \"difficult to combat\" drug-resistant microorganisms are on the rise, per the Post. Some good news is that C. auris hasn't morphed yet into new strains, and most people's chances of contracting it are very low, with it only affecting \"the sickest of the sick,\" says CDC infectious disease specialist Tom Chiller. Also encouraging: a recent study IDing an antifungal that may prove useful.

Where did it all go wrong for the Wisconsin governor? Insiders tell Politico that Walker was overconfident, and though he tried to act as his own campaign manager, he seemed to be \"making it up as he went along,\" causing plenty of strategic blunders. Fundraising dried up as Donald Trump's rise pushed him to the sidelines, leaving him with a large organization but little support. His sudden departure from the race came after he failed to make an impression at the second debate and a CNN poll found his support at well below 1%. \"He was a terrible candidate, but he also got Trump-ed,\" a source tells Politico. More: Sources tell CNN that although a super PAC supporting him had plenty of cash, Walker's campaign funds started to dry up after the first debate as donors looked elsewhere. Walker \"is a pragmatist above all else and just didn't see the path to a comeback\" after his poll numbers collapsed even in Iowa, a campaign insider says. Walker was hurt by flip-flops on issues like birthright citizenship, where he changed his position three times in a week, CNN notes, and by gaffes like suggesting he would consider building a wall along the Canadian border. In his exit speech last night, Walker said he had been \"called to lead by helping to clear the field in this race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field.\" He urged other candidates to follow his lead so a clear alternative to Trump could emerge, the Washington Post reports. Some of Walker's former rivals praised him as he left the race, including Marco Rubio, who called him \"one of the best governors in the country,\" and Donald Trump, who said \"he's a very nice person and has a great future,\" reports the Hill. The rival campaigns didn't wait until Walker announced his exit to start trying to poach his aides and his donors, the AP reports. The competition heated up after the announcement: A source close to the billionaire Ricketts family, which had supported Walker, tells the AP that within minutes of the governor's press conference, the family received calls from six campaigns, some of them from the candidates themselves.

The spate of headlines was kicked off by an official state health advisory warning that the drink, usually served in a copper mug, poses a health risk if the wrong kind of mug is used. For the uninitiated, a Moscow Mule has vodka, ginger beer, and lime, and thus is acidic, explains Live Science. The problem is, you're not supposed to serve acidic beverages in mugs with a copper interior because it raises the risk of copper leaching into the drink. Solution? A mug with a copper exterior is fine, but make sure the interior is made of stainless steel, nickel, or some other alternative. The advice isn't new, but the state felt compelled to issue the advisory given the \"recent popularity of Moscow Mules.\" (A cruise through Instagram proves the point.) Iowa's warning is based on an FDA advisory from a few years ago. Specifically, it says that drinks with a PH level of 6.0 or under should not be served in pure copper mugs, and the Mule falls into that category.

Hanks was serving on a jury in LA this week, but when a lawyer in the City Attorney's Office made the mistake of talking to the actor, the case had to be settled with a plea deal. The prosecuting attorney revealed the interaction Tuesday and asked for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct, CNN reports. Instead, yesterday, both sides agreed to a reduced charge. The defendant initially faced up to a year in jail on domestic assault charges; the reduced disturbing the peace charge carries with it just a $150 fine. So what did the lawyer approach Hanks about? He reportedly thanked the actor for his service. TMZ earlier reported that Hanks was either an awesome juror or just acting like one: taking lots of notes, listening closely, talking to the other jurors during the breaks, and laughing at one of the lawyer's jokes. The defense attorney confirms to CNN that, though he was initially skeptical of putting Hanks on the jury, \"He never looked or made any statements like he wanted to get off jury duty. So based on everything, he seemed like a very fair juror.\" How would he have voted? The defense attorney says Hanks simply \"looked at me like he always had, smiled and said, 'I was going to vote the way of justice.'\"\n\nAbout 1% of the US population (around 3.2 million Americans) has a gambling disorder, per the National Center for Responsible Gaming\u2014and the Atlantic tells the tragic story of one of those addicts and how a lawsuit took the entire industry to task for his death. Scott Stevens was a successful Ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in Vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: He sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings\u2014until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, Stacy started researching gambling addiction (she hadn't even known about her husband's problem) and filed suit against the West Virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site ATMs, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance\u2014or what the industry refers to as \"continuous gaming productivity\"\u2014so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, Terry Noffsinger, the lead attorney for the Stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \"negligence. It's intentional.\" Stacy Stevens lost her case in West Virginia, but Noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \"The public is learning more about it,\" he says. (Read about the tech behind the slot machines here.)\n\nJesse Matthew, charged with the abduction of missing UVa student Hannah Graham, was found in Galveston, Texas, Wednesday on a \"beach out in the boonies,\" as one Texan put it. After a tip, police spotted Matthew camped out on a sliver of sand on the remote Bolivar Peninsula\u2014the site of a mass grave used decades ago by serial killer Dean Corll and accessible by a single road, the AP reports. Matthew is one of many to hole up on the spot (among others: famed French pirate Jean Lafitte, rumor has it), where some stay for months. \"We get lots of weird folks,\" says a local. \"It seems like a good place to seek refuge. It's kind of remote.\" More on the case from the Washington Post and the Daily Progress: Matthew initially said he was \"George Carr,\" but police discovered his true identity when they ran his car's plates. Authorities have searched the car, beach, and sand dunes. The case has brought to light another accusation against Matthew. An official has confirmed he was accused of raping a woman at Liberty University in 2002, but she didn't proceed with the case. He was a student there at the time. \"Basically, the woman was saying she hadn't consented and Matthew was saying she had,\" says an attorney with the Lynchburg Commonwealth Attorney's Office. Searchers have scoured much of Charlottesville, Va., and are moving on to surrounding farms and woodland. They've asked area real estate agents to inspect any vacant buildings or properties they represent, and have told the public to be on the lookout for Graham's iPhone 5S with a pink case or unexplained tire tracks. Authorities are also looking to identify some of Matthew's favorite fishing spots. Matthew has declined to fight his extradition, and Virginia police have been sent to retrieve him.

Pakistan earlier warned of \"disastrous consequences\" if the US carries out other, similar raids in the future. Despite the admitted shortcomings, Pakistan's army says the country's Inter-Services Intelligence agency gave initial information to the CIA. In its statement, the first since the raid, the army threatened that if the US carries out more raids like Sunday's, it will review its cooperation with Washington. The Washington Post notes that Pakistan's foreign minister also appeared to question whether the US raid was legal, citing UN Security Council resolutions and suggesting the raid may have breached international law.\n\nYou probably can already identify the contents of most of your photos, but this is still fun. A new website from Stephen Wolfram, whom you may know from the search tool WolframAlpha, lets you drag and drop any photo; it will then in theory identify what's in it. Right now, ImageIdentify manages some impressive feats, the Verge reports: For instance, it was able to tell that a picture of a cow was a black angus. On the other hand, it thought a cupcake was a bottle cap. The Wolfram Language team is happy to acknowledge the mistakes. In a blog post, Wolfram notes that \"somehow the errors seemed very understandable, and in a sense very human. It seemed as if what ImageIdentify was doing was successfully capturing some of the essence of the human process of identifying images.\" In the meantime, it does have some practical uses: At PC World, Jared Newman writes that \"using the site, I was able to figure the breed of dog that kept following my wife and I around on our honeymoon (miniature pinscher) and the exact type of flower from a hike in Los Angeles (larkspur).\" And we can expect ImageIdentify to get better at its job, since it keeps copies of the images you post and learns from them; its abilities come from the study of tens of millions of pictures, Wolfram says.

Author Bill Hillmann was living his Ernest Hemingway fantasy in northern Spain on Saturday when a bull gored his buttocks and tossed him in the air. The Chicago man hit the ground, looked back, \"and he was just on me,\u201d Hillmann tells People. \"At the last second, he shot me straight up in the air. The horns just went in in a really weird way.\" As the 1,200-pound beast named Sentido stormed away along the narrow streets of Pamplona, Hillmann says he didn't feel \"piercing pain\" and managed to pick himself up and walk to find help. He didn't realize he'd been gored until \"the medics pulled my pants down and there was blood everywhere.\" Hillmann, 35, spent 36 hours in the hospital but vowed to run with the bulls again on Monday. \"I\u2019m a daredevil at heart. It\u2019s just who I am,\" he says. The last time Hillmann, who has run with the bulls at the annual San Fermin festival for 12 years, caught the wrong end of a horn was in 2014. That goring badly tore up a leg. \"The first time, I wasn't walking for a week,\" he tells the AP. There have been five gorings and other minor injuries since the festival began on Friday. One victim, a 22-year-old California man, had his left arm impaled and was dragged for several yards, per the AP.

Italy was declared malaria-free in 1970, and the mosquito that carries the disease no longer lives in the country. \"It baffles us how she could have been infected,\u201d NBC News quotes a doctor at a hospital in Trento as saying. Sofia Zago was brought to the hospital on Saturday with a high fever and quickly fell into a coma. Tests showed she had cerebral malaria, the deadliest form of the disease, and she died Monday after being moved to a hospital in Brescia. A doctor says it was the first case of native malaria he's seen in Trento in 30 years. \"It's a mystery, almost impossible,\" the general manager of the provincial health service says regarding the case. Doctors believe Sofia may have been infected during a trip to a beach resort near Venice. It's possible she was infected by a mosquito that had managed to travel to Italy inside of luggage. It's also possible, though very unlikely, Sofia contracted the disease a few weeks ago when she was hospitalized for childhood diabetes. The BBC reports there were two children at the hospital at the same time recovering from malaria they picked up in Africa, though they were in a different ward and Sofia received no blood transfusions. Italy's health ministry has ordered an investigation, according to the AP. While Europe was declared malaria-free in 2015, there have been several individual cases of locally transmitted malaria in recent years, including one in Rome in 2009. (After decades of work, a malaria vaccine is finally here.)\n\nThe man who police say killed five people in Manchester, Ill., yesterday turns out to have been the one who helped save the 6-year-old girl he shot, reports the Chicago Tribune.

She had been shot several times and is now in critical condition with facial injuries. \"It's devastating, simply devastating,\" says Manchester Mayor Ron Drake\u2014who happens to be Smith's uncle.

And should you buy anyway in the likely event that it is? Here's what people are saying: Farhad Manjoo at Slate gives a first-hand account of the confusing and frankly downright shady process for buying the coins. \"You've got to take several leaps of faith, trusting sites that look like they were put together by teenagers,\" he writes. But that's why he thinks this bubble still has legs. Bubbles, he theorizes, take off when mainstream buyers get involved. Once better Bitcoin sites appear, the masses will arrive, and \"prices will begin to get really crazy.\" Speculators \"are just laughing at all the people who are dismissing Bitcoin as a bubble,\" writes Henry Blodget at Business Insider. Because the most you can lose on Bitcoins is 100% of your money\u2014and you stand to make much more than 100% back. Like, say, 600% (which investors have made in the last six weeks). That said, lots of things could obliterate the market, like hacking, or a government crackdown. Timothy Lee at Forbes thinks Bitcoins are a bonafide disruptive technology. \"The Bitcoin economy today looks a lot like the PC market circa 1978,\" he observes. \"Most people today look at Bitcoin and see an impractical curiosity.\" But Bitcoin isn't a product, it's a platform, and one with lots of room to grow. But Kurt Eichenwald at Vanity Fair is far, far less convinced, calling the system \"very cool. But also very foolish.\" Bitcoins aren't a currency anymore\u2014currencies are based on \"a rational expectation of relatively stable valuation,\" and Bitcoin prices are anything but stable or rational. \"In essence, the market is a fantasy,\" based on speculators and investors. And when they stop buying, who will replace them? \"My bet?

Jill Kelley and her surgeon husband founded the Doctor Kelley Cancer Foundation in 2007, stating that it \"shall be operated exclusively to conduct cancer research and to grant wishes to terminally ill adult cancer patients.\" But records reveal that the charity went bust later that year, having spent every penny of the $157,284 it started with on expenses like parties, entertainment, and travel. The charity also listed $12,807 for office expenses and supplies, and $7,854 on utilities and telephones, which is a little on the steep side for a charity that operated out of the couple's mansion, the HuffPo notes. But the charity isn't all that's surfaced on Kelley: The mansion where Kelley and her husband threw lavish parties for military top brass has been in foreclosure since 2010, reports the New York Daily News. The couple owes vast sums to banks and credit card companies and has been hit by at least nine lawsuits. Kelley isn't just an unpaid social liaison to nearby MacDill Air Force Base, she's an honorary consul of South Korea, an embassy official tells Foreign Policy. \"She assumed this position last August thanks to her good connections and network,\" the Korean official says, adding that the position is symbolic and has no official responsibilities. Kelley tried to invoke \"diplomatic protection\" in one of several 911 calls made over the last few days, Fox reports. Complaining about trespassers on her property, Kelley told the dispatcher, \"I'm an honorary consul general ... I don't know if you want to get diplomatic protection involved as well, because that's against the law to cross my property because, you know, it's inviolable.\" The Wall Street Journal adds that over the summer, Kelley became worried about personal information getting aired and tried to get the FBI to drop its investigation into threatening emails Paula Broadwell sent her.

They uncovered what the CBC labels a \"dodo whodunit.\" Though scientists had assumed the dodo kept at Oxford University Museum of Natural History died of natural causes, inside its mummified skull were 20 to 30 \"metallic high-density particles\" that left no doubt how the male bird met its end: \"He was shot in the back of the head with a shotgun,\" Williams says, adding \"we could be looking at the first examples of lead shots ever used to hunt game birds.\" Now begins the search for the culprit: Museum director Paul Smith says a chemical analysis of the lead pellets will hopefully reveal \"what country the shot was made in so we could then determine who killed the dodo.\" The Oxford specimen\u2014the most complete dodo to be found and the only one to contain soft tissue and viable DNA\u2014was previously thought to be from a dodo displayed in London in 1638 before its natural death, per the Telegraph. \"Was it shot in the UK? More likely, was it shot in the Mauritius and then transferred to the UK? Was it shot for food on a ship?\" Williams wonders, per Live Science.

Obama \"laid out no discernible second-term agenda of his own,\" and his attack on Romney's \"supposed plans to eradicate all of government while giving tax cuts to the wealthy\" was the speech's \"sole coherent message,\" he writes.

So report researchers at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2016, where they've presented their findings.

The Sun went ahead and published the photos, even though the royal family's lawyers specifically asked it not to. The paper likes Harry and \"is NOT making any moral judgment\" about his behavior, it explains. It simply believes \"Sun readers have a right to see them.\" Why? Because the photos have sparked a debate about Harry's lifestyle, considering he officially represents Britain, and thus any Brits without Internet access could not fully take part in that conversation. \"There is a clear public interest in publishing the Harry pictures, in order for the debate around them to be fully informed.\" More on Harry: The prince was pictured hugging an also-naked woman \u2026 because he's so chivalrous. \"He hugged her to cover her up.

He dismissed the vote's validity, saying, \"today's events in Catalonia can never be portrayed as a referendum or anything similar.\" Clashes broke out less than an hour after polls opened. Polling station workers reacted peacefully and broke out into songs and chants challenging the officers' presence.

But causation hadn't been proven, and the latest study on the topic indicates those warnings may be baseless. The latest study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, followed 949,504 pregnant women, 64,389 (6.8%) of whom used antidepressants during the first trimester\u2014the period of the most rapid cell division, when the risk of developing such defects is highest, WebMD explains. What Krista Huybrechts of Brigham and Women's Hospital did differently: She and her team took into consideration factors that could lead to heart defects, like the mother's age and whether she had diabetes. The Boston Herald reports that among babies whose mothers did not take antidepressants, 72.3 per 10,000 were born with a cardiac defect, compared with 90.1 per 10,000 infants whose mothers did. After controlling for risk factors, \"there is no evidence to support a substantial increased risk of cardiac malformations overall,\" says Huybrechts. Still, she cautions that antidepressant use during pregnancy poses a \"whole range of other potential adverse outcomes.\" To wit, one expert pointed to \"serious flaws\" with the study. For one, it didn't flag miscarriages, which are linked to antidepressants. \"It may be that the most severely affected pregnancies are miscarrying,\" he noted."}, {"generated_summaries": "\"Giving permission to shoot a strongly protected animal without a clear potential threat is a criminal offence,\u201d Chris Heinrich, a WWF board member said in a statement which explained why they decided to file charges against the head of a public order office in Brandenburg.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAfter more than 250 years a wild bison had been spotted again in Germany and all the authorities could think to do is shoot it.\u201d \ufffd  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Heinrich blamed a \u201clack of professionally trained staff in the area\u201d. he added that \"the state of Brandenburg has proven itself to be less than professional in its treatment of wild animals in the past, as shown by how it deals with wolves and elk.\" =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- \ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd8e\ufffd Witnesses recorded an incident where a white woman called the police on a black father who was coaching his son from the sidelines.Police found no wrongdoing and did not detain the father.It is the latest in a string of occurrences where white people have called 911 on black people who have done nothing wrong..

That apparently set \"Gail\" off, and she told the dad \"harassment won't be tolerated\" and \"continued to harass and beleaguer him.\" NBC News explains talking to the ref in a game isn't permitted, but Williams writes the man explained he was talking to his own son. He finally offered to just leave to defuse the situation, Williams adds, at which point \"Golfcart Gail\" said she was still calling the cops \"because she no longer felt safe with his threatening behavior.\" (NBC News also has some video.) A rep for the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office says the woman in the golf cart is an athletic association field marshal, and the head of that group says the cops were called not just because of that dad, \"but as a result of a culmination of several immediate prior incidents\" at the game, including a mom who was cursing and another dad who'd been ejected for being verbally abusive, per WTLV.

Calling the killing a criminal offense, the World Wildlife Fund says it will file charges against the official who gave the order, the Local reports. \u201cAfter more than 250 years a wild bison had been spotted again in Germany and all the authorities could think to do is shoot it,\" says Chris Heinrich, a WWF board member. The bison was seen by the river Oder near the eastern town of Lebus on Wednesday. Thinking the beast was a threat to public safety, a local official sent a pair of hunters to take care of it. It was unclear if any of them knew the European bison is classed as a \"vulnerable\" species and on Germany\u2019s list of \"strongly protected animals.\" The victim was likely a bull that had wandered across the border from Poland from its home in a national park. While they may be the continent's largest land mammals, weighing up to 2,200 pounds, the bison are not considered dangerous. If they were, says the local environmental minister, then \"half of Poland, where the animal is a national symbol, would have to be declared a danger zone.\" Hunted to near extinction in Europe in the early 20th century, the bison are making a comeback thanks to conservationists, with more than 1,200 now roaming around Poland, per the Telegraph, which published a video showing bison fleeing, then standing up to, a pack of wolves.

Two carved sphinxes flank the entrance to the tomb, which is surrounded by a 540-yard marble outer wall. \"It looks like the tomb of a prominent Macedonian of that era,\" a culture ministry official tells Reuters. Archaeologists have spent the last couple years excavating the ancient burial mound under which the tomb was found, and they plan to enter the tomb within the next two weeks, reports NBC, which adds that there is one clue to its possible occupant: Researchers believe a 16-foot stone lion unearthed in the area a century ago and associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, one of Alexander the Great's military commanders, once stood atop the tomb.

Today's discerning Instagrammers require a new way to document their every waking moment. Enter the Nokia 8 and its \"bothie.\" Nokia's attempt to compete with Samsung and Apple in the high-end smartphone market hits stores in Europe in September. Wired reports the Nokia 8 is standard stuff for a high-end smartphone; it's got 64 gigs of storage, 4 gigs of RAM, a 5.3-inch screen, and so on. And the Verge came away fairly unimpressed by the phone, calling it \"average,\" especially compared to what Apple apparently has planned for its new phone.

The resulting video or image shows whatever is in front of the user alongside the user's reaction to it. Those photos and videos can then be shared directly to Facebook or YouTube. Wired calls the bothie the Nokia 8's \"only truly unique feature,\" meaning the phone was made \"for the YouTubers and Instagrammers of the world.\" And they'll have to embrace the bothie if Nokia has any chance of competing with Apple and Samsung.

Researchers at San Diego State University report in the journal Psychological Science that when people want to portray themselves as powerful or authoritative, their voices go up in pitch, become more monotone, and exhibit more variation in loudness. What's more, listeners hear and identify these differences as powerful, reports Medical News Today. The researchers were inspired to study vocal volume and inflection because of the oft-told story of Margaret Thatcher's vocal coaching when she became prime minister of the UK, reports the Association for Psychological Science. \"It was quite well known that Thatcher had gone through extensive voice coaching to exude a more authoritative, powerful persona,\" one researcher says. \"Amazingly, power affected our participants\u2019 voices in almost the exact same way that Thatcher's voice changed after her vocal training,\" another says.

As New Zealand's University of Canterbury celebrates 100 years since it acquired the 16-foot genealogical scroll, British scientists will begin studying the 15th-century manuscript next week in the hope of discovering hidden features. Using specialized equipment, they'll complete \u201cground-breaking work that has never before been applied to this type of manuscript,\u201d according to a release. Researchers have so far gathered that the manuscript dates to the Wars of the Roses, a series of wars fought for England's throne by two noble families: the Lancasters and Yorks, who became the Lannisters and Starks in George RR Martin's Game of Thrones, per Mental Floss.

Gargiulo decision upholds the stipulation that third-party texters can only be liable if they are aware the driver is texting and will view the text while on the road.However, the New Jersey court also rejected the umbrella argument that someone is liable simply because they know the person they are", "gt_summaries": "- Court rulings in Pennsylvania and New Jersey are taking texting-while-driving laws down a new road, opening the door to not only holding the offending driver liable for a car accident, but perhaps also the person texting the driver, Consumerist reports. In neither case has anyone (yet) had to legally assume this burden: In the 2013 New Jersey appellate case, the \"remote texter\" was let off the hook because there wasn't enough evidence to show she knew her friend\u2014who severely injured two people after slamming into their motorcycle\u2014was driving when she texted him, the ABA Journal reports. And in the Pennsylvania case, the judge's ruling didn't hold responsible the two texters who were sending messages to the driver when she crashed into a motorcycle, killing that driver\u2014it was simply determined the texters were fair game for the suit, per the Legal Intelligencer. But the fact that holding non-driving texters liable for car crashes is even being considered is starting to slowly impact the legal landscape on distracted driving. The New Jersey and Pennsylvania cases underscore the challenges in such cases. For instance, it's not enough to hold a texter liable simply because he or she texted a driver: Certain conditions must be met, such as knowing (or having good reason to believe) the driver would pick up the phone to check out texts while driving, as well as proving a \"special relationship\" exists between texter and recipient to influence the recipient picking up. But these kinds of cases, as well as other proposed crackdowns on car texters (including New York's controversial \"textalyzer\" bill), show the issue is being given heavier weight. \"People often see distracted driving as a socially acceptable sin \u2026 an innocuous guilty pleasure in which everyone indulges,\" a University of South Carolina law professor tells Vocativ. \"The same used to be true of drunk driving ... These legal developments could signal that a similar change in thinking is underway regarding distracted driving.\" (Jenny McCarthy's son called the cops for her texting-while-driving transgression.)\n\nThe eldest son of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro has taken his own life after months of being treated for \"profound depression,\" according to state-run media in Cuba. Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, nicknamed \"Fidelito,\" was 68. Castro-Diaz Balart, who was born during Castro's brief, pre-Cuban Revolution marriage to Mirta Diaz-Balart, headed Cuba's national nuclear program from 1980 to 1992 and was serving as a scientific adviser for the Cuban Council of State at the time of his death, Reuters reports. Castro Diaz-Balart was born in 1949. His mother took him to live in the US after she divorced Castro in 1953. She sent him to visit his father after he took power in 1959 and he never returned him, CNN reports. Castro Diaz-Balart trained as a nuclear physicist in the Soviet Union and spoke Russian, Spanish, English, and French fluently. Paul Hare, a former British ambassador to Cuba, tells Reuters that Castro Diaz-Balart seemed \"thoughtful, rather curious about the world beyond Cuba\" when he met him at a dinner in Boston two years ago. \"But he seemed a bit weary about having to be a Castro, rather than himself,\" Hare says. The BBC reports that he was related on his mother's side to prominent anti-Castro regime politicians in the US, including his cousin, Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart. (Fidel Castro died 14 months ago at 90.)\n\nFacts and numbers were flying in last night's debate, and President Obama and Mitt Romney agreed on so few of them that \"the two men seemed to be inhabiting two parallel universes,\" Politico observes. Thankfully, a swarm of fact-checkers have been poring over the candidates' statements to sort things out. Here are some of the more egregious fibs: Romney: \"I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit.\" Independent analysis indicates that Romney's tax plan would add $5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. Romney says he'll pay for that by reducing deductions and credits, but the Tax Policy Center concluded that was \"mathematically impossible.\" Obama: \"We've made some adjustments\" to Simpson-Bowles. Obama's plan is not, as he implied, comparable to Simpson-Bowles. It's much less aggressive, doesn't touch Social Security, and, while it too reduces the deficit by $4 trillion, it takes an extra year to do it. Romney on green energy loan recipients: \"I think about half have gone out of business.\" Try three out of 26. Romney: Dodd-Frank \"designates a number of banks as too big to fail.\" The law designates some banks for special treatment, but that treatment involves extra regulation and a way to liquidate them if they run into trouble; they are not, as Romney argued \"effectively guaranteed by the federal government.\" Romney: \"Pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan.\" Romney's health care plan only covers people with pre-existing conditions if they \"maintain continuous coverage,\" which was more or less the situation before ObamaCare. Obama: \"Under Governor Romney's definition \u2026 Donald Trump is a small business.\" Romney's plan doesn't actually define small businesses. But the federal government does, and under its guidelines, Trump is a small business, because he owns some businesses with fewer than 500 employees, according to CNN. Obama: \"I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.\" True, but that plan counts savings already agreed on during the debt ceiling debate. Romney: \"The president said he'd cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it.\" When Obama took office, the projected deficit for 2009 was $1.2 trillion. For fiscal 2012, the deficit is expected to be $1.1 trillion, the New York Times reports."}, {"generated_summaries": "A New York restaurant has a pulled a dessert called \u2018Roofie Colada\u2019 from its menu after angry backlash over social media.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Phunky Elephant in Staten Island is known for its decadent after dinner creations like its Cookie Crumble Martini and Milky Way cocktail.The dessert was a dessert-drink hybrid made with coffee ice cream, Kahlua, vanilla vodka, caramel, chocolate syrup, topped with donuts and whipped cream.The name is allegedly derived from a joke on the cartoon \"Family Guy,\" reports Advance media via SILive.com.Patricia Gaja, who owns the gastropub, admitted that she had been receiving complains about the dish for months, but felt that recent backlash was getting out of hand.A friend of Jurkiewicz's, Ilyssa Silfen, In nearly half of those cases, the AJC found, the doctors remain licensed to practice medicine, no matter whether the victims were patients or employees, adults or children.. \ud835\uddae\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd9e\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd9c\ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd96\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd92\ud835\udd84\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd8f\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd80\ud835\udd81\ud835\udd8c\ud835\udd90\ud835\udd89\ud835\udd93\ud835\udd87 \ud835\udda5\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd82\ud835\udd9d\ud835\udd83\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd85\ud835\uddaa\ud835\udda8\ud835\udda4\ud835\udda6\ud835\uddb6\ud835\uddb4\ud835\uddba\ud835\uddaf\ud835\uddb9\ud835\uddb3\ud835\uddbb\ud835\uddb8\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddb2\ud835\uddab\ud835\uddbf\ud835\udda3\ud835\udda1\ud835\uddb5\ud835\udda9\ud835\udda2\ud835\uddb1\ud835\udda7", "gt_summaries": "- Entertainers, journalists, and politicians have lost their careers over sexual misconduct in the age of #MeToo, but it seems doctors have little to worry about.

Most undergo no medical-license review and need only avoid trouble for a five-year period.

The company has filed a patent application for a passenger aircraft in that very shape, the Financial Times reports. Why go for the doughnut look? Well, current aircraft face heavy pressure on their front and rear ends, requiring special support. \"The purpose of the invention is particularly to provide a simple, economic, and efficient solution to these problems,\" Airbus says. The new design, which you can view here, also offers more room for passengers, CNBC reports. The \"doughnut\" does, of course, have its drawbacks. Boarding hatches\u2014in the doughnut's \"hole\"\u2014don't clearly fit emergency exit rules, Fortune notes, and the aircraft's shape might require airport redesigns. Either way, don't expect Dunkin' Donuts to start an airline anytime soon. \"It\u2019s just one of many ideas,\u201d an Airbus rep tells Fortune. \"It doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to be working on making it a reality.\" In fact, the company seeks more than 600 patents yearly, the rep tells the publication (though the Financial Times puts the figure at 6,000). For instance, Airbus recently sought a patent for standing \"seats\" that are basically bike saddles.

Luke Thompson of E! Online finds the film's framing device peculiar: \"Every so often, we go back and forth between the dramatization and the 'real' people being interviewed.

Chris Christie can move forward, a judge in the state ruled Thursday. Bill Brennan, whom the Star-Ledger describes as a \"citizen activist\" and Christie's office describes as \"a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system,\" filed the complaint last month over the 2013 BridgeGate scandal. Per Brennan's complaint, Christie knew lane closures were happening and could have put a stop to the whole thing. The complaint is based on testimony from the trial against former Christie aide Bridget Anne Kelly and former Port Authority executive Bill Baroni. During the trial, a man Christie appointed to Port Authority testified that both he and Baroni told Christie about the lane closures during a 9/11 ceremony (the lanes were closed from Sept. 9 to Sept. 13, 2013). Now that the judge has ruled the complaint can move forward, it will go to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office so a decision can be made as to whether Christie should be indicted. Christie's office, which insists the governor had no knowledge of the lane closures while they were ongoing, said it would appeal the judge's ruling. The Star-Ledger reports that the courtroom audience, \"mostly there for minor criminal violations,\" applauded the judge's ruling. The judge issued a criminal summons for Christie, the New York Post reports.\n\nDetails of Keith Olbermann\u2019s abrupt exit from MSNBC\u2014as well as what\u2019s in store for him now\u2014are trickling out.

They were designed to mimic the \"hands of Gods, pulling a strip of gold out of the land,\" says Vu Viet Anh of TA Landscape Architecture in Ho Chi Minh City, which designed the new pedestrian bridge in Thien Thai Garden.

For instance, it concludes that Incognito didn't intend to cause \"lasting emotional injury\" or drive Martin to quit the team\u2014Martin left in October over the abuse, but remains under contract\u2014and it cites a range of factors that make this case unique. Some of the highlights: 'Was indeed harassed': \"To be candid, we struggled with how to evaluate Martin's claims of harassment given his mental health issues, his possible heightened sensitivity to insults and his unusual, 'bipolar' friendship with Incognito. Nonetheless, we ultimately concluded that Martin was indeed harassed by Incognito, who can fairly be described as the main instigator, and by (teammates John) Jerry and (Mike) Pouncey, who tended to follow Incognito's lead.\" Other victims: Incognito, Pouncey, and Jerry also repeatedly harassed a member of the team's athletic training staff and another unnamed lineman, reports USA Today. Calls for new guidelines: \"As all must surely recognize, the NFL is not an ordinary workplace. Professional football is a rough, contact sport played by men of exceptional size, speed, strength, and athleticism. But even the largest, strongest, and fleetest person may be driven to despair by bullying, taunting, and constant insults.\" The report encouraged new \"workplace conduct rules\" for the league. 'Breaking Jmart': One of the more damning points cited against Incognito is that he fined himself $200 for \"breaking Jmart\" in a notebook kept by the team's offensive linemen, reports CBS Sports. When the story broke, he asked teammates to destroy the notebook, but that didn't happen. Coaches didn't know: The report says coach Joe Philbin and staff were unaware of the abuse. It also says that \"Incognito and his teammates may not have been clearly notified that they were crossing lines that would be enforced by the team with serious sanctions.\" Read the full report here.

Walruses tend to head ashore two weeks after warm temperatures cause sea ice to recede too far north for them in the Chukchi Sea. This year, it happened earlier than ever. Walruses typically use sea ice for protection and as a home base, particularly for juveniles, while adults dive to the ocean floor for food. But \"when that ice retreats to the deeper water, they can't do that,\" Fish and Wildlife rep Andrea Medeiros tells Alaska Public Media. For the past several years, a barrier island near Point Lay has served as an alternative home base. Last year, thousands of walruses had arrived there by Oct. 7.

The country will begin cutting its FM network on Wednesday, starting with the northern city of Bodo, before moving south. All five national channels on FM will stop broadcasting by the end of the year, per Vocativ, though some local stations will continue FM broadcasts until 2022. The plan has been in place for years as digital radio costs Norway the same as the FM network, $29 million, but allows for eight times more radio stations. But residents aren't impressed. A poll shows 66% of Norwegians oppose the move, compared to 17% in favor and 17% undecided, reports Reuters. Among the critics are the owners of 2 million vehicles without digital audio broadcasting receivers who will need a $170 digital adapter and those who fear emergency alerts usually broadcast on FM radio will go unheard. \"We are simply not ready for this yet,\" says a member of the ruling coalition government, noting \"millions\" of in-home radios will be rendered useless. \"But Norway has made its decision,\" says the chairman of the Norwegian Local Radio Federation. \"For practical and economic reasons it is too late to turn back now.\" Norway will now be watched closely by the UK, South Korea, Sweden, and Denmark, all considering the switch. Switzerland plans to switch to digital in 2020.

Shipments to Japan, which have been suspended since September due to disputes involving the arrest of Chinese fishermen, also resumed, though they are facing some delays. The decision came hours after an announcement by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that she would travel to China tomorrow to discuss the matter. She called the suspension a \u201cwake-up call,\u201d saying the US and Japan need to find alternate supplies of these materials. China, which produces 95% of the world's rare earth minerals, has repeatedly downgraded its export levels of these materials over the last five years; what it currently ships is well below world demand.

The scientists grafted nerves from elsewhere in the rats' bodies to their severed spinal cords, and the rats eventually were able to pee again almost as well as healthy rats, reports Science News. The rats were not able to walk again, and while they didn't regain full control of their bladders, the study is still \"an astonishing breakthrough for the field,\" writes Liat Clark at Wired. Any similar research on humans is still years away because the results must first be replicated on animals bigger than rats, reports the BBC. Previous attempts to regenerate nerves on damaged spinal cords were stymied by scar tissue at the site of the original injury. The scientists were able to overcome that by using an enzyme to break down the scar tissue, in tandem with a growth factor that helped the transplanted nerves grow. \"This is one of the most important steps that I have seen in recent years,\u201d says an Oslo neuroscientist not involved with the study.\n\nToday is the 7th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, and for residents of Plaquemines Parish, it's deja vu all over again, according to the parish president. Billy Nungesser tells NPR that the parish, located some 95 miles from New Orleans, has already seen damage that rivals, and could even surpass, that heaped upon it by Katrina. With the levee overrun, Nungesser says parts of the parish that had escaped unscathed in previous hurricanes now sit under five feet of water. \"I don't know who's calling this a Category 1, but this is no Category 1,\" Nungesser said. \"My house has more damage than it did during Katrina.\" More on the situation in Plaquemines, and beyond: The parish's levees range from 8.5 feet to 12 feet in height.

The news offered context for things both women had long noticed: Juneski was the only blonde among redheads and brunettes, while Jourdeans, a redhead, was surrounded by lighter-haired kin.

But the voices of Kamba men didn't prompt much worry. \"They are making such a fine-level discrimination using human language skills,\" a study author tells the AP. \"They're able to acquire quite detailed knowledge.\" The elephants also appeared to be able to distinguish between men and women: Maasai women's voices didn't set off major alarm bells, nor did Maasai boys'.

A measure with the nickname the \"French Patriot Act\" cleared the lower house of Parliament in France today, reports France24. The legislation now goes to the Senate, where it seems likely to pass, reports the New York Times, which provides some specifics: The provisions would let intelligence services \"tap cellphones, read emails and force Internet providers to comply with government requests to sift through virtually all of their subscribers\u2019 communications.\" Advocates insist the monitoring would be directed at suspected terrorists, but critics don't buy it. A nine-person committee set up to oversee the surveillance would have only an advisory role and could not overrule the prime minister. The measure \"shows a number of tactics that seem cribbed from the NSA, including bulk collection of internet metadata, which would allow the government to track French citizens from site to site,\" notes a post at the Verge. The legislation also allows intelligence services to put microphones in a room or on objects to record conversations, and to use other devices to intercept phone conversations and text messages. The French debate follows the attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices, and \"many in the Socialist Party who would normally have spoken out against the new powers have instead kept quiet,\" observes the BBC. \"In the wake of the January attacks, there is little political mileage in raising doubts about the intelligence services.\" (In the US, things seem to be moving in the opposite direction.)\n\nPresident Trump doesn't appear to be heeding calls to end his rhetoric in regard to North Korea. In a pair of tweets, he boasted about America's nuclear prowess. \"My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal,\" he tweeted. \"It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before.\" He then added, \"Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!\" Earlier, in response to North Korea's threat to strike Guam, Trump retweeted a Fox News story about US Air Force jets taking off from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam for a training mission, with a caption noting pilots could be ready to \"fight tonight,\" notes the Wall Street Journal. Related: Ad-lib? The New York Times reports that Trump's \"fire and fury\" line from Tuesday was improvised. The newspaper says the president did not run the language by advisers in advance, including chief of staff John Kelly. A piece of paper Trump had in front of him was reportedly a fact sheet on the opioid crisis. Politico reporter Josh Dawsey's sources tell him the words were not \"carefully vetted,\" adding, \"Don't read too much into it.\" Mattis weighs in: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson may have had a more calming tone on the subject Wednesday, but defense chief James Mattis followed up with some tough language. Among other things, he warned in an afternoon statement that North Korea should \"cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and destruction of its people,\" per CNN. American nukes: Trump's tweets on the US arsenal were apparently in reference to a review of nuclear weapons that was ordered on Jan. 27 but isn't expected to be completed until year's end, reports the Washington Post. Such reviews are required by Congress about every eight years. After the last one in 2010, Barack Obama announced a $1 trillion plan to upgrade the nuclear arsenal over 30 years. Given all that, fact-checkers are pushing back on Trump's boast that he beefed up the arsenal, and that's putting it mildly.

Scientists say they've identified a molecule that \"reverses\" the effects of Down syndrome in mice. The molecule is called sonic hedgehog pathway agonist, and it was administered to mice who were genetically altered to have characteristics akin to those of Down syndrome. The molecule, which is not approved as safe for humans, spurs a gene to make a protein tied to development. \"Most people with Down syndrome have a cerebellum that's about 60% of the normal size,\" says one of the Johns Hopkins researchers. Science World Report notes that the mice were injected on the day they were born, at which point their cerebellums hadn't fully developed. The single injection appeared to normalize the cerebellum's growth. In an added surprise, memory and learning, \"which are generally controlled by the hippocampus, not the cerebellum,\" were also positively affected. But the researcher explains that applying the treatment to humans is a tricky proposition, and could have unintended consequences, like raising cancer risk."}, {"generated_summaries": "His fans cheered in support of a potential presidential bid by Charlie Sheen. | Photo by Reuters Close  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"I understand this place has some f\u2014king history,\" he said, referring to the nation's capital as \"Awesome-ville\" as he sported a Washington Nationals jersey. \"I've got some history, too.\" \ufffd  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sheen wasn't the only head turner at DAR on Tuesday: Tareq and Michaele Salahi were there to take in the show and enjoyed plenty of posing with fans..

Taking a cue from depression treatment, researchers at the University of Siena in Italy found that bright light stimulates testosterone levels and led to better results in the bedroom, reports the BBC. Using a light box lined with fluorescent tubes, researchers tested the effects on 38 men diagnosed with low libidos. One half were exposed to bright lights, and the rest to lower doses of light. Those who received the brighter lights for 30 minutes daily over two weeks tripled their rate of sexual satisfaction.The amount of testosterone in the control group didn't change, but the bright-light group saw their levels rise to 3.6 nanograms per milliliter from 2.1. \"The increased levels of testosterone explain the greater reported sexual satisfaction,\" said lead author Andrea Fagiolini, per the Independent. He said testosterone production among men in the northern hemisphere declines naturally from November through April (peaking in October). \"The use of the light box really mimics what nature does,\" Fagiolini said. He said light therapy \"inhibits the pineal gland in the center of the brain and this may allow the production of more testosterone, and there are probably other hormonal effects.\" Light box therapy is commonly used to treat depression caused by Seasonal Affective Disorder. Although researchers cautioned that more research was needed, light therapy could be a promising hope for men whose sex drive is off, particularly during the winter months.

Try December of that year, when Steve Carell boarded John McCain's campaign bus \"and changed the entire trajectory\" of the show, writes Chris Smith at Vanity Fair. The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show. Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don\u2019t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.)

In search of herbivores to maintain land areas at risk of becoming barren, geneticists began breeding aurochs descendants with similar cattle breeds in 2008 and found they could \"produce animals far closer to the aurochs than we would have expected,\" says Ronald Goderie of the Tauros Project. Fourth-generation beasts have now been introduced in Croatia, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic, and Romania, with promising results. \"We see progress not only in looks and behavior but also in de-domestication of the animals,\" says Goderie, noting one herd has learned to defend itself against wolves. The hope is that they will become part of the ecosystem to maintain land for other animals. But a rep for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature says it's unclear \"whether primarily wetland forests like the aurochs used to inhabit still exist, whether it could negatively impact wild or domestic plants or animals, and if it might endanger people.\" Indeed, a British farmer had to kill some of his aurochs-descended cattle in 2015 because they tried to kill him, per the Independent.

The University of Tennessee researcher has found one particular Caribbean species that apparently hunts together. Dinets' study in the Animal Behavior and Cognition journal details his research on Chilabothrus angulifer, or the Cuban boa, which Tennessee Today notes is the country's largest resident predator on land and which apparently hunts fruit bats in sinkhole caves in a coordinated way. Dinets observed the snakes for eight days in the caves of Desembarco del Granma National Park, where he had noticed they would hang from the ceiling near the entrance at dawn and dusk, ready to pounce when the bats flew in and out of the caves. But it wasn't just random positioning. The snakes hunkered down in close proximity to each other, in seemingly strategic locations, so when the bats tried to pass, they were trapped by a \"hissing, snapping curtain\" of boas, as ScienceAlert puts it. What signified coordination and not just a shared preference for one location: No snake positioned itself in the same \"segment\" twice. Dinets also notes that one to three snakes were present for each hunt; only two boas failed to catch a bat, and both were hunting solo. When successful, it took one boa an average of 19 minutes to catch a bat, but three only 6.7 minutes. What's unclear is how rare this is: There are 3,650 snake species, but the natural hunting habits of just a handful have been studied. \"It will take a lot of very patient field research to find out\" if others hunt like this, too.

Mammuthus creticus is the tiniest mammoth ever found, and is another example of \"dwarfism\" on islands, where scare resources can keep animals small, notes the Telegraph. Fossilized teeth of the three-foot-tall mammoth were first discovered in 1904, but were initially believed to be elephant teeth. Scientists only recently re-examined them and determined they were evidence of a miniature mammoth. They also returned to the spot in Crete and discovered a mini leg bone. \"Dwarfism is a well-known evolutionary response of large mammals to island environments,\" said lead researcher Victoria Herrige from London's Natural History Museum. \"Our findings show that on Crete, island dwarfism occurred to an extreme degree, producing the smallest mammoth known so far.\" Researchers believe the animals may have evolved from regular-sized mammoths as long as 3.5 million years ago.\n\nA judge on Friday tossed out a $417 million jury award to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer by using Johnson & Johnson talc-based baby powder for feminine hygiene, the AP reports. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Maren Nelson granted the company's request for a new trial, saying there were errors and jury misconduct in the previous trial that ended with the award two months ago. Nelson also ruled that there wasn't convincing evidence that Johnson & Johnson acted with malice and the award for damages was excessive. The decision will be appealed even though Eva Echeverria has died, said her attorney, Mark Robinson Jr. \"We will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by this dangerous product,\" he said in a statement. Echeverria alleged Johnson & Johnson failed to adequately warn consumers about talcum powder's potential cancer risks. She used the company's baby powder on a daily basis beginning in the 1950s until 2016 and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2007, according to court papers. Her attorney contended that documents showed that Johnson & Johnson knew about the risks of talc and ovarian cancer for three decades.

(This after Pope Francis in March warned mobsters to repent or \"end up in hell.\") Specifically, he implies he has information about the 1983 disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi, the 15-year-old daughter of a Vatican employee. Calcara wrote that what happened has been kept secret \"because to reveal it would be like opening a box and bringing to light truths so weighty as to throw into crisis a system that links the Vatican with other deviant entities.\" It's not Calcara's first run-in with the church: Years ago, he claimed that Ali Agca, who attempted to assassinate Pope John Paul II in a St. Peter's Square shooting in 1991, was a hitman hired by the mafia, according to the Catholic Herald. And in 1994, the AP reported Calcara claimed that a US archbishop who once ran the Vatican bank had helped mobsters launder $6.5 million through the bank. That allegation was denied by the cardinal who ran the Vatican bank at the time."}, {"generated_summaries": "In this photo released by the Israeli Defense Ministry, released Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit, second right, walks with his father Noam, right, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, second left, and Defense Minister Ehud Barak, left, at the Tel Nof Air base in southern Israel, Tuesday, Oct. 18, 2011. / HO, Ariel Hermoni,AP Photo/ Defense Ministry  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Updated 2:45 PM EST \u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 MITZPE HILA, Israel - The father of the Israeli soldier freed in a swap for Palestinian prisoners said his son will need time to recover from psychological and physical wounds after five years in Hamas captivity.  petertodd \udbbf\udfff \ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd9c\ud835\udd9e\ud835\udd92\ud835\udd86 \ud835\udd9a \ud835\udc52 \ufffd BHOPAL: A wedding celebration came to an abrupt end in Bhopal when a man shot dead the bride, his first cousin, on the stage when the newly married couple was posing for photographs with guests late on Thursday.Anurag Singh, 31, shot Jayshree Namdeo, 26, from very close range and appeared to turn the pistol towards himself when relatives overpowered him and thrashed him at Sundervan Marriage Garden in the Lalghati locality around 11.15 pm.One more shot was fired in the melee and a guest was injured.The police said Anurag, who was nearly lynched and had to be hospitalised, told the police that he loved the girl, a doctor posted in the children\u2019s ward of the Gandhi Medical College, and could not bear to see her getting married to In \"Eat Pray Love,\" Julia Robert's character, Liz Gilbert, takes a holiday from her miserable life as a well-respected, financially secure New York writer, loved by men she cannot love back and despairing of her own inner emptiness.She travels the world to seek enlightenment, a journey -- she never hesitates to tell anyone she meets -- outside her own comfort zone.For the viewer though, it's anything but.The film never ventures, even once, into a situation that does not reek of comfy familiarity.Of course, the Elizabeth Gilbert memoir on which the movie is based also got criticized for its Western fetishization of Eastern thought and the overly self-conscious nature of this journey -- reportedly paid for with a publisher's advance for the book itself.None of that stopped her memoir from becoming a bestseller translated into", "gt_summaries": "- Eat, Pray, Love looks lovely but lacks both the spice and the depth of the best-selling memoir it's based on, say critics.

Namdeo, a pediatrician, refused his hand in marriage, and Singh reacted to her engagement by saying on Facebook that he might kill himself.

At the wedding in Bhopal, Singh waited the near the stage for an hour before shooting Namdeo, and tried to shoot the groom and himself but only grazed himself and injured a guest.

Roseann J. DiFrancesco apparently tripped and fell, causing her medical alert necklace to become caught on her walker, the Patriot-News reports. The result, says Coroner Charles Hall, was that her upper torso was suspended above the floor, creating pressure on her neck that cut off air and blood flow. Relatives had last spoken to DiFrancesco on Feb. 12. A visiting nurse found the woman dead in her bathroom Feb. 15, when the nurse entered DiFrancesco's home after unsuccessful attempts to summon her by knocking on the door. It is unclear when DiFrancesco died. Her death was ruled an accident, Fox 43 reports. The device (similar to the ones popularized by \"I've fallen and I can't get up\" commercials) did not have a breakaway lanyard, as some do, per the Patriot-News. The FDA has warned of potential choking with such devices, which typically include a pendant with a button to call for help, saying the agency is aware of at least six serious injuries or deaths related to their use between 1998 and 2009. \"Risks are greater for those with mobility limitations or for those who use wheelchairs, walkers, beds with guard rails, or other objects that could entangle with a neck cord,\" the FDA says in a press release.

The suit, which the AP notes was filed on behalf of several groups, says the proposed 85% reduction at Bears Ears is an \"extreme overreach in authority\" and puts at risk dinosaur fossils and Native American artifacts, among other resources. Patagonia owner Yvon Chouinard told CNN of his litigious plans earlier this week, noting, \"This government is evil, and I'm not going to sit back and let evil win.\" President Obama designated Bears Ears a national monument at the end of 2016; Grand Staircase-Escalante received the protection 20 years earlier from President Clinton. At the heart of the commotion is whether a current president can walk back a former president's creation of a national monument under the Antiquities Act, with Native American tribes, environmental groups, and paleontologists arguing that Trump doesn't have the authority to do so; two legal experts interviewed by the AP had varying opinions on the matter. NBC News, which notes the legal wrangling over the national monuments could stretch out for years, adds that Patagonia has long been active in fighting for Utah's public lands.

On top of that, they had to ensure that the plane could be just as technologically sound today as at the end of its projected 30-year lifespan.With $15 billion worth of research and development under its belt, Airbus is hoping that its no-nonsense approach to design and engineering will help it best the competition\u2014namely the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and 777 long-distance planes.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The fuselage is wider to accommodate larger passenger seats in economy class\u2014just an extra inch over the standard width\u2014and easier movement down the ais", "gt_summaries": "- If it works, it could be an air-traveling perk to trump all others: no more jet lag. Airbus is making the bold claim that it can at least reduce the malady for those aboard its new A350 XWB line of jets. The main tool is a set of LED lights within the cabin that mimics natural shifts in sunlight and theoretically keeps people's natural circadian rhythms in sync, reports Fast Company. Another factor: Because of the planes' relatively light frames, they can be pressurized to 6,000 feet, which the airline says allows for more humidity and makes the air pressure inside the aircraft closer to the pressure on the ground than is the case with most jets, per Quartz. A third factor is the jet's filtration system, which replaces the air in the cabin in its entirety every two to three minutes. The idea there is that, if nothing else, the improved air quality should help people sleep better on long flights. And the big question: Has it worked? It's a little too early to tell. The first such jet landed in the US only earlier this month via Qatar Airways, though other airlines plan to add the jet to their fleets, notes a post at Science Alert.

That's particularly worrying since the batteries on the jet's black boxes have likely just about run out. But \"we need to continue (searching) for several days right up to the point at which there's absolutely no doubt that the batteries will have expired,\" says Angus Houston, the Australian official leading the search, per CBS News. \"If we don't get any further transmissions, we have a reasonably large search area of the bottom of the ocean to prosecute and that will take a long, long time,\" Houston says. The ship is carrying an autonomous underwater vehicle that can search the depths for the plane, \"literally crawling along the bottom of the ocean,\" Houston notes. Trouble is, findings so far point to \"a large area for a small submersible that has a very narrow field of search.\" Once the vehicle, called Bluefin-21, does head downward, it will conduct 20-hour sonar missions to try to find the plane.\n\nPresident Obama's commencement address at Howard University on Saturday is still reverberating, with some ranking it among the best speeches he has ever delivered.

If she had \"refused to participate out of some sense of ideological purity,\" he said, \"then those great ideas would have just remained ideas. But she did participate.

Other developments include: Police also haven't identified any of the suspects, but Adebolajo's name was widely reported yesterday, and today the Telegraph has identified the other alleged knife-man as the confusingly similarly named Michael Adebowale, 22. Neighbors identified Adebowale after police armed with submachine guns raided his flat yesterday, emerging with two children, a baby, and two large envelopes. Adebowale was apparently known for distributing radical Islamist leaflets, and his girlfriend had recently converted to Islam. \"When you walked past, you would hear them singing Muslim songs,\" one neighbor says, adding that she \"saw the man who was in the video go inside the house.

The force and grace of his opinions propelled film criticism into the mainstream of American culture,\" writes Douglas Martin. \"Not only did he advise moviegoers about what to see, but also how to think about what they saw.\" The Chicago Sun-Times, his longtime stomping grounds, praises his \"stunning work ethic,\" noting that \"we who felt such intense pride in being Chicago Sun-Times journalists simply because Roger was one of us ... were all better for his example and friendship.\" His wife offers a poignant statement, per NPR, on \"my husband, my friend, my confidante, and oh-so-brilliant partner of over 20 years.\" Their romance, Chaz Ebert says, was \"more beautiful and epic than a movie.\" Though he was \"happy,\" she notes, \"he was also getting tired of his fight with cancer, and said if this takes him, he has lived a great and full life.\"\n\nTo Mandy Patinkin, it's inconceivable that Ted Cruz has been uttering lines from The Princess Bride along the campaign trail\u2014and the actor, who played Inigo Montoya in the 1987 cult film, has had enough. \"How can I stop this?\" was Patinkin's reaction when friends started emailing him about images online that featured Cruz's face Photoshopped onto his character's body, he tells the New York Times. Cruz has long said the movie is his favorite, and he's committed a good portion of it to memory (including Patinkin's famous line: \"Allo, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die\"). But Patinkin isn't sure Cruz understands the film's subtext: namely that, despite the film focusing partly on his character's mission for vengeance, the real meaning revolves around the movie's hero rescuing his true love. \"[Cruz] is not putting forth ideas that are at the heart of what that movie is all about,\" Patinkin tells the Times in a tone the paper describes as \"increasingly vexed.\" Patinkin cites one of his character's final lines in the movie as one that should stand out more to Cruz: \"I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.\" The 63-year-old actor's beef with Cruz is that he's too focused on that revenge, preying on voter anxiety by, as the Times puts it, \"exploiting fears about immigrants and Muslims.\" Says Patinkin, \"Open your arms to these people, these refugees trying to get into our country, and open your hearts.\" A spokeswoman for Cruz's campaign told the Times in an email that \"having some fun with a cult classic \u2026 should be something we can all get behind, politics aside.\" In other words, no \"as you wish\" from Cruz.

The sequel brings back the absurdity of the first and even takes a few swings at satire, and while it may not equal its predecessor, critics say it's worth a watch. \"It's not unusual for comedies to sink to silly-stupid depths. A rare few are bona fide silly-funny. Anchorman, and now its follow-up, fall into the latter category of inspired lunacy,\" writes Claudia Puig in USA Today. \"The chemistry and improvisational energy of this comic quartet\"\u2014Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, and David Koechner\u2014\"fuel the comedy.\" Meanwhile, \"nearly anyone who is anybody in contemporary comedy ... makes an appearance.\" Anchorman 2 \"recaptures the silly, sloppy spirit of its predecessor, minus the crucial element of surprise. It\u2019s a frequently amusing, occasionally hilarious, rarely unpleasant grab bag of mild mockery and inspired lunacy,\" observes AO Scott in New York Times. The film \"manages to make some smart satirical hay in the course of its stupidity,\" writes Chris Vognar in the Dallas Morning News. \"At times, Anchorman 2 blurs the line between depicting stupid and being stupid. At other times, it\u2019s a spot-on parody, not just of cable news\u2019 dawn but also its current incarnation.\" \"While I'm glad Anchorman is back,\" notes Betsy Sharkey in the Los Angeles Times, \"I do wish it were better. With so many sight gags and nearly every living comic in the world making an appearance at some point, the entire operation, like Ron's ego, feels a bit bloated.\" But Carell and Kristen Wiig \"create some of the strangest romantic chemistry the big screen has seen in a while\u2014maybe ever.\""}, {"generated_summaries": "Updated 6:50 a.m. ET  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \ufffd  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 WASHINGTON The bizarre journey of Edward Snowden is far from over.

But \"intensified cooperation\" may not be coming: The Washington Post reports that a Russian official today told Interfax that Moscow doesn't have the legal authority to comply with the US government's request.

The airline Aeroflot told the AP he was booked on a Moscow-Havana flight this morning (the expectation being he'd then travel to Venezuela and then to Ecuador, where WikiLeaks says he will seek asylum), prompting a number of journalists to grab seats on said flight. But Snowden apparently never boarded, reports Business Insider via an article with this headline: \"Russia Just Punked a Bunch of Journalists Who Are Now On Their Way to Havana.\" AP Moscow correspondent Max Seddon confirmed that there was no sign of Snowden, tweeting, \"Cuba here we come. Taxiing down Sheremetevo runway and no sign of Snowden. Seats empty still by 17A.\" How did Snowden get out of Hong Kong yesterday to begin with? Despite the Chinese territory's autonomy, the final decision came from Beijing, sources tell the New York Times. The move lets China save face while avoiding a drawn-out extradition battle. Some legal experts are telling the New York Times the US government goofed in waiting until Saturday to revoke Snowden's passport, though charges were filed June 14. Says a former federal prosecutor, \"They missed an opportunity to freeze him in place.\" Still, the Times notes that Snowden may have still been able to fly to Moscow sans passport thanks to special refugee travel documents from Ecuador that WikiLeaks helped Snowden obtain.\n\nFrench authorities have arrested two more people\u2014a man and a woman\u2014in connection with the Thursday terror attack in which Mohamed Lahaouaiej Bouhlel drove a large truck through Bastille Day crowds in Nice, France. The man, a 37-year-old, is suspected of giving weapons to Bouhlel, 31, who was shot and killed by police during the rampage, the Telegraph reports. Just before the attack, according to reports, Bouhlel sent a text that read: \"Bring more weapons, bring five of them to C.\" In another text, he says: \"I've got the material.\" The latest people arrested were described as an \"Albanian couple,\" per the Telegraph. With the latest arrests, seven people have thus far been detained for having a possible link to the attack, the Washington Post reports, though Bouhlel's ex-wife was released Sunday. As authorities in France investigate the third major terror attack in that country in 18 months, additional details have emerged. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls tells a French newspaper, \"We now know that the killer was radicalized very quickly.\" The Los Angeles Times reports Bouhlel started frequenting a mosque just three months ago; prior to that, acquaintances say he did things that don't jibe with Muslim codes, like smoke pot and wear shorts. Footage from security cameras in Nice shows Bouhlel driving along the Promenade Des Anglais on the two days before the attack.

A primer: Unions: Since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones. Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. \"It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\" a lawyer says. Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008.

But a new report by Amnesty International shows that not only has the practice continued into the present day\u2014it's given Iran the dubious distinction of being \"one of the leading executioners of juvenile offenders,\" the New York Times reports. At least 73 youngsters have been executed in Iran between 2005 and 2015, per the report, and at least 160 juveniles are now on the country's death row, and those are probably conservative numbers (the report notes actual figures are probably higher but unknown because info about the death penalty is \"shrouded in secrecy\").

This in spite of supposedly significant changes to the country's Islamic Penal Code\u2014changes meant to offer judges \"alternative punishments\" to the death penalty when juveniles are involved. In fact, the need for those changes in the first place shows what a dismal failure Iran has been in dealing with this issue, since in 1994 it ratified its participation in the UN's Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that \"neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed [on] \u2026 persons below 18 years of age.\" \"The report debunks recent attempts by Iran's authorities to whitewash their continuing violations of children's rights and deflect criticism of their appalling record as one of the world's last executioners of juvenile offenders,\" the Amnesty report reads.

The Hill reports that around 200,000 signed up for health care coverage on the first day of this year's enrollment period, compared to 100,000 last year. Such early enthusiasm is good news for fans of ObamaCare, many of whom assumed enrollment would be down this year due to actions by the Trump administration, including slicing the advertising budget by 90% and cutting the length of the enrollment period by half. Still, despite the early high numbers, analysts say early enrollees tend to be renewing coverage, not getting it for the first time. Last week Standard & Poor's said enrollment could drop by as much as 1.6 million this year. With the government's advertising budget just $10 million, some insurance companies are spending their own money to spread the word about the enrollment period, Reuters reports. These companies are using advertising both to bring in the young, healthy customers whose coverage keeps premiums down and to clear up any confusion about the cessation of subsidies under Trump. The ObamaCare numbers come as reports have surfaced that the Trump administration is preparing an executive order that would effectively wipe out the mandate that most Americans have health insurance. The order would state that the administration will not collect the tax penalties from people who fail to get coverage, CNBC reports.\n\nJPMorgan is staring down a lawsuit over Bear Stearns' alleged mortgage-backed securities misconduct.

In Fiat Chrysler's case, the EPA\u2014which was to announce its findings in a Thursday morning conference call\u2014believes the automaker's software permitted emissions beyond what's allowed by the law, in more than 100,000 SUVs and trucks sold since 2014.

Yahoo is struggling and Facebook is about to go public; suits like this are common in such cases, an expert tells the Wall Street Journal. Another tells Reuters that the timing might make Facebook \"more willing to resolve\" the differences. The suit alleges that Facebook succeeded by using principles \"Yahoo had its pulse on\" years earlier, a former Yahoo exec says; one example is Facebook's newsfeed, which is similar to Yahoo's patent for custom data streams. \"With this lawsuit Yahoo is saying they had the ideas first,\" the exec says.

The announcement follows a critical report in Mother Jones that revealed Ethos water came from private springs in Baxter, an area deemed to be in \"exceptional drought.\" Asked by Mother Jones about concerns surrounding a dwindling water supply for residents, a company rep said Ethos' source \"is not used for municipal water for any communities.\" However, the spring water got bottled in nearby Merced, also under severe drought conditions, and the company used city water as part of the process.

According to 2011 agency documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the NSA grabs \"millions of images per day\"\u2014about 55,000 of which are good enough for facial recognition. The agency doesn't take them from state databases of US passport photos or driver's licenses, said an NSA spokeswoman, but she wouldn't say whether social media sites or State Department databases were fair game. Law enforcement agencies already create facial-imagery databases\u2014relying on Facebook and driver's-license photos, for example\u2014and the FBI is combining fingerprints with facial imagery and other data. But the NSA can match its images with vast troves of information it has already intercepted. So, is this legal?

US will soon have a level playing field, or better.\" Trump has been feuding with the American motorcycle maker since June, when it announced it would shift production of some bikes destined for the European Union from the US to overseas to avoid tariffs the EU introduced as a response to Trump's steel tariffs. Harley\u2014which has plants in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania but is planning to close one in Missouri by the end of next year\u2014says it stands to lose $100 million a year from the tariffs, though Trump accuses the company of using tariffs as an excuse to move production out of the US, CNN reports. Harley-Davidson declined to comment on the latest remarks from Trump, who welcomed bikers to his golf course in Bedminster, NJ, on Saturday, the AP reports. CEO Matt Levatich told CNBC last month that Trump's remarks were \"unfortunate attention\" at a time when the company is being forced to make tough choices because of stagnant motorcycle sales in the US.\n\nSix people died after losing air conditioning at a Florida nursing home whose power was knocked out by Hurricane Irma, Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief confirmed in a press conference Wednesday. Sharief said three people died at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills and two more were declared dead at a hospital, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. A sixth death was announced in a press release later Wednesday morning. It may have all been due to extreme temperatures at the facility, though the causes of death haven't yet been officially determined. A police rep simply said \"a number of people\" were \"in respiratory distress\" at the facility; 115 people were evacuated from it. More on the deaths and other Irma-related news: Hollywood Police Chief Tom Sanchez says precautionary checks are being performed at the other nursing homes in the area, the Miami Herald reports. Sanchez says a criminal investigation into the deaths has been opened. The Airstron employee who had been trying to fix the AC unit tells Local 10 that a fuse needed to cool the unit popped out during the hurricane. He says he's been trying to repair the facility's unit for days, but Florida Power & Light (FPL) has yet to fix the fuse for him despite his phone calls.

Bottom line: \"This may be the place to go look for life in the outer solar system,\" says a Cornell scientist not involved with the new study in Nature. That would be microbial life, under conditions similar to those in a network of hot springs under the Atlantic Ocean known as the \"Lost City,\" reports AP. Some scientists think that ancient hydrothermal field yielded the first life on our planet. Some extra-terrestrial sleuthing resulted in the Enceladus discovery: Knowing that a geyser shooting up from the moon's south pole sends up dust particles that settle on Saturn's outer ring, researchers analyzed the outer ring. They discovered that the dust particles were mostly silica, explains Popular Mechanics, and the makeup of that silica yielded details about the ocean in which they were formed. \"We think that the temperature at least in some part of the ocean must be higher than 190 degrees Fahrenheit,\" team member Sean Hsu tells NPR. \"If you could swim a little bit further from the really hot part then it could be comfy.\" The only way to \"nail the habitability question\" is to send up a new spacecraft to Enceladus with more modern instruments, says the Cornell researcher.

Flu season started earlier this year than it has in the past 10 to 12 years, and by the end of 2012, 18 children had died and 2,257 had been hospitalized as a result. And things could get much worse: One Mayo Clinic expert recalls that \"a decade ago, when we had widespread circulation [of seasonal flu], we had 70,000 deaths in the US.\" The proportion of people with flulike symptoms and the states reporting such illnesses are both on the rise, and a flurry of local stories today illustrate the problems in various states: There's quite an abundance, but here's a sampling: Flu cases spiked in New Jersey last month, the Star-Ledger reports; the state has seen about twice the number of flu-related ER visits as it did last year. In Chicago, some ERs are actually turning away patients because they're so overwhelmed with flu cases, CBS Chicago reports. In Cleveland, medical centers are limiting visitors in an effort to control the spread, Fox 8 reports. And in Florida, even people who got a flu shot still got sick, ABC News reports.

The massive leak of internal documents from Bermuda-based law firm Appleby is spurring headlines like this one: \"Lewis Hamilton avoided taxes on \u00a317m jet using Isle of Man scheme.\" It has also led Bernie Sanders to warn of a \"rapid movement toward international oligarchy.\" In a statement to the Guardian, he says the papers show \"how these billionaires and multinational corporations get richer by hiding their wealth and profits and avoid paying their fair share of taxes.\" Two apparent examples, as revealed by some of the 13.4 million records being examined: Apple: The tech giant has employed a maneuver called the \"double Irish\" that allows the company to route its non-Americas revenue in a way that incurs very little tax. The EU in 2013 decided to probe this arrangement, and Ireland cracked down: It announced that firms incorporated there wouldn't be allowed to be stateless for tax purposes, as Apple's Irish subsidiaries were. The Paradise Papers leak reveals Apple found its state. Communications between Applelby and Apple show Apple asking about the benefits that might come from various options (think Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man).

Nike: The Guardian reports the Paradise Papers spell out exactly how Nike has been able to reduce its tax burden, and says the Netherlands is key. From 2005 to 2014, the revenue from sales throughout Europe went there, and much of it then traveled to Bermuda via its Bermudan subsidiary, Nike International Ltd. That subsidiary was pretty much a shell: no office, no staff, but it possessed Nike's intellectual property rights, which let it impose big royalty fees of Nike's European headquarters, which created the funnel that legally allowed profits to move to the Bermuda subsidiary. Then things got even weirder with the creation of the subsidiary Nike Innovate CV which is based ... nowhere.

Multiple phrases, including \"Ahab's lust for vengeance,\" appear both in SparkNotes and Dylan's talk, but not in Moby Dick itself.

Pitzer suggests that Dylan donate some of the prize money to the SparkNotes writer, though others are more forgiving. University of Minnesota music professor Alex Lubet tells the Star-Tribune that Dylan's lecture shouldn't be treated like a classroom assignment. \"His lecture is wild and strange,\" Lubet says. \"It\u2019s meant to be a post-modern work of art.

Researchers looked at about 30 years of data on more than 78,000 women and 44,000 men and found that those who were five-for-five on the aforementioned list had a significantly better life expectancy at age 50 than those who didn't abide by any of the healthy habits. For women, it meant an additional 43 years for the healthiest group, compared to 29 years. For men, it meant an additional 37.6 years, compared to 25.5 years. \u201cWhen we embarked on this study, I thought, of course, that people who adopted these habits would live longer,\" says co-author Meir Stampfer, per the Guardian. \"But the surprising thing was how huge the effect was.\" The two big factors: Those with the healthiest lifestyles were less likely to get cancer or heart disease, notes CNN.

Franklin, a former garbage collector and police garage attendant, would kill his victims and leave them partially clothed or naked in alleys and dumpsters near his home, according to CNN. He was tied to killings in 2010 using new DNA technology. The AP reports a cop posing as a busboy got Franklin's DNA off pizza crusts and napkins following a birthday celebration. It matched saliva found on the breasts of many of the victims. More than 60 witnesses testified during the three-month trial. A surviving victim (Franklin was also found guilty of attempted murder) recalled Franklin luring her into his car, abruptly shooting her in the chest, then getting on top of her. The last thing she remembered before passing out was a camera flash. She said he pushed her out of the car when he thought she was dead. A number of Franklin's victims were prostitutes or drug addicts; all of them were black. The murders never gained the attention received by other slayings in California, and many blamed police indifference for them going unsolved. Families of the victims, many in tears, were present when the verdict was read. \"He doesn't value life,\" CNN quotes the sister of Franklin's 15-year-old victim as saying. \"He doesn't care.\" Prosecutors believe they have evidence of at least five more victims."}, {"generated_summaries": "Although top senators, including Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Marco Rubio, are urging the administration not to bend on ZTE, President Trump is planning to ease penalties on the Chinese telecommunications giant for violating sanctions against Iran and North Korea.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But what Mr. Trump may not realize is that ZTE is also one of the world\u2019s most notorious intellectual property thieves \u2014 perhaps even the most notorious of all..

Just 49% of Americans polled from late August to early September said they supported capital punishment for people guilty of murder, while 42% said they opposed it, according to the Pew Research Center. Recent botched executions by lethal injection may be responsible for the drop in support from March 2015, when 56% of Americans backed the death penalty, reports Business Insider. But support has actually fallen across the political spectrum since the mid-1990s, when support reached 80% as violent crime and murder rates rose, per the Washington Post. Some 57% of white Americans now support the death penalty, compared to 29% of blacks and 36% of Hispanics, according to the poll of 1,201 adults. Men, older Americans, and those without a college degree are also more likely to support the death penalty. But just 34% of Democrats support capital punishment, compared to 71% two decades ago, reports the New York Times. Some 72% of Republicans support it, down from 87%, and 44% of independents support it, down from 57%. As support has fallen, so have the number of executions.

According to NPR, the raids were the first since President Trump signed a Jan. 26 executive order on undocumented immigrants. That order redefined \"criminal alien,\" expanding the definition beyond the couple million \"bad hombres\" the president mentioned during the campaign to include undocumented immigrants who are only suspected of a crime or those who've committed low-level offenses, such as using a fake Social Security number to get a job, the Hill reports. All last week, homes and businesses were raided in broad daylight\u2014a change in tactic from the Obama administration that one government aide says is possibly meant to \"send a message\" under Trump. Immigrant advocates are also reporting that ICE agents are stopping immigrants at random or going door to door in minority-heavy neighborhoods to ask for IDs, though ICE denies these tactics. There have also reportedly been major raids in Kansas, Texas, Florida, and Virginia. Many advocates see this week as punishment for sanctuary cities and an attempt to \"instill fear\" in immigrants. And while officials maintain they're targeting undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records, advocates say it doesn't help their case that the first deportation under Trump was a \"working mom with two US kids.\"\n\nOfficials have released a name in the case of the American nanny found dead in her Vienna, Austria, apartment on Tuesday night, but beyond that, much remains unclear. ABC News reports Lauren Mann, 25, died by suffocation, though it notes that Vienna police rep Thomas Keiblinger earlier referenced a preliminary autopsy that found no indications of strangulation. NBC News echoes the report of suffocation, but CBS News and the AP report the autopsy was inconclusive, and their reports don't mention suffocation. CBS cites officials who on Thursday confirmed Mann was not strangled, shot, or stabbed. The case is being treated as a homicide, and an official tells NBC News \"third party involvement cannot be excluded\"; police say there are no suspects at this time. Keiblinger says it'll take a week or two for the toxicology report to be completed, which has CBS saying her death \"could be [a] mystery for weeks.\" ABC reports Mann failed to pick up one of her charges from school on Monday, but her half-dressed body wasn't found until 6pm the following day.

The CIA is scrambling to deal with the fallout from WikiLeaks' release Tuesday of a vast trove of data on the agency's hacking tools. A former senior intelligence official tells the Washington Post that the leak, which experts believe is genuine, could \"cause grave if not irreparable damage to the ability of our intelligence agencies to conduct our mission.\" A roundup of coverage: One hack, code-named Weeping Angel, allows spies to capture audio and possibly video from Samsung smart TVs that appear to be turned off. Wired has a guide to telling whether your TV has been hacked. PC World reports that the WikiLeaks release included snippets of code that antivirus vendors can now use to determine whether hacking attempts originated at the CIA. MIT Technology Review describes the leaked information, including news that the CIA has found vulnerabilities in iOS and Android, as \"sinister\" but not \"particularly Earth-shattering\" from a technological point of view. Business Insider examines some of WikiLeaks' claims and finds that there's no evidence that the CIA was able to crack the encryption of apps like Signal and WhatsApp. Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, tells the New York Times he's disturbed by signs that the government knew about vulnerabilities in electronic devices and kept them quiet to make spying easier. \"Those vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and governments around the world,\" Wizner says. \"Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone's digital life safer.\" Forbes spoke to security experts from several companies about the leak. They said the information about the CIA's technological capabilities is unsurprising, but that it should serve as a reminder to people that they cannot fully trust the security of their devices. \"People need to wake up to the fact that they need to take responsibility for maintaining the privacy of their information and make no assumptions,\" says Ajay Arora, CEO of Vera. \"At the end of the day, no one has your best interests in mind but you\u2014people can't even trust their own government anymore. This is the tragic new normal we have to all unfortunately accept.\" Companies including Google, Samsung, and WhatsApp declined to comment, the Washington Post reports. Apple released a statement saying the issues disclosed in the leak were patched in a recent update and that they \"always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security update.\" \"Imagine a world where the actual CIA spends its time figuring out how to spy on you through your TV.

The Washington Post reports doctors tested 4,000 Medicare patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia and discovered many of them definitively do not have Alzheimer's. Using PET scans, the study revealed only 54.3% of mild cognitive impairment patients and 70.5% of dementia patients had brains containing amyloid plaques. These plaques can be a sign of Alzheimer's. The patients who had them may or may not have Alzheimer's; the remaining percentage definitely don't have the disease. \"To get that right diagnosis, that's really important,\" one woman, whose Alzheimer's diagnosis was ruled out by a PET scan, tells the AP. The findings show many people are potentially taking unnecessary Alzheimer's medication, and doctors may want to change their treatment to something cheaper or more effective. Unfortunately, the only ways to test for amyloid plaques while a patient is alive are expensive PET scans, which aren't usually covered by insurance, or invasive spinal taps. Or are they? Another study presented at the same London conference revealed a new blood test that could potentially reveal the plaques, New Scientist reports. The tests are easy and cheap enough that doctors could administer them to patients during regular checkups. Since plaques start showing up 15 to 20 years before Alzheimer's symptoms, patients could use the results to change certain lifestyle habits to decrease their risk.

According to data on British kids, it sure does. Using information on 18,000 children gathered over \"an extended period of time,\" researchers from the London School of Economics say kids born to first-time moms in their 30s have better cognitive scores and \"behavioral outcomes\" than first-born children with mothers in their 20s, the Independent reports. \"First-time mothers in their 30s are, for example, likely to be more educated, have higher incomes, are more likely to be in stable relationships, have healthier lifestyles, seek prenatal care earlier, and have planned their pregnancies,\" lead author Alice Goisis tells the Times of London. These kids also outperformed children whose moms were in their 40s. Published in Biodemography and Social Biology, the study also found that children born to women in their 40s are more often obese because their moms don't play with them as much. This despite the fact that moms that age typically smoke less and breastfeed their kids, Marie Claire notes. But researchers acknowledge they culled data from only 53 mothers in their 40s. There's also the question of what defines intelligence: \"Of course kids who have parents with more resources to offer (i.e., good schools, tutors, even high-quality nutrition) are going to do better when it comes to school and tests. But are book learning and intelligence really the same thing?\" asks Jacqueline Cote at Cafe Mom. \"And I'm not saying that simply because the two children I had in my 20s are honor students!

Pay and benefits will soon make up 60% of the military budget (currently, the cost of military personnel is about 50% of the budget), meaning that if they're not curbed, there won't be enough money for new weapons or training within the decade, Dempsey said.

Some drivers woke up in their cars Friday morning after being stuck overnight on the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx. Accidents on the George Washington Bridge halted traffic on the crossing and led to backups in New York and New Jersey. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he understands people are frustrated that city officials were caught off guard by the storm and promised \"a full review of what happened here.\" A mayoral spokesman said the early storm meant that Metropolitan Transportation Authority didn't have snow chains on its buses. He said many of them had to pull over, \"further clogging streets.\" The delays for buses created a logjam, forcing officials to close the doors Thursday at New York's Port Authority Bus Terminal.

One of the most surprising things, according to NBC News, was that a 25-year-old had top-level security clearance. But apparently it's not that unusual.

The so-called \"Panama\" disease is spreading thanks to a single clone of the Fusarium fungus, also called Tropical Race 4, scientists report in the journal PLOS Pathogens. Worse still, one of the world's most popular bananas, the Cavendish, is particularly susceptible to this strain. The soil-borne fungus travels up the plant's roots, ultimately killing the plant and infesting entire banana plots, which are then contaminated for years. Entire swaths of banana plantations in Australia, China, the Philippines, Jordan, Mozambique, Pakistan, and beyond have been infested in the past two years, putting many farmers and families out of business and cutting them off from a major food source, reports PhysOrg. Right now the only way to fight the disease is through strict quarantine, so researchers are trying to spread the word about effective measures in the hopes of getting a step ahead of the fast-spreading fungus before it hits Latin America, where most of the world's bananas are grown.

That report also notes women in low- and middle-income countries carry much of the burden of breast and cervical cancers, with less access to quality care and a greater likelihood of dying from their illnesses than women in richer nations. Perhaps a bit ironically, some of the cancers in the lower-income countries used to be prevalent only in higher-income ones, but as the poorer countries started going through \"rapid economic transition,\" the women there began experiencing risk factors like their more affluent counterparts, including \"physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, obesity, and reproductive factors\" like putting off having kids, per an ACS VP. \"The global community cannot continue to ignore the problem\u2014hundreds of thousands of women are dying unnecessarily every year,\" Richard Sullivan, co-author of the Lancet report, says in the release.

Check out these 10 particularly memorable musician tributes to Nelson Mandela The Guardian\u2019s investigation found that traffickers are using government websites to obtain personal information including mugshots, release dates and charge sheets to identify potential victims while they are still behind bars.Pimps and sex buyers are locating incarcerated women awaiting a court date by using personal data such as mugshots and bail bonds posted online, or through corrupt bondsmen.Once released, the women are told they must work as prostitutes or have their bond rescinded and be sent back to jail.Just as he had promised, Richard Rawls, a career criminal and convicted felon with more than 47 charges for sexual battery, child abuse, drug possession and assault, was there to pick her up.The letters promised Kate a future she never imagined possible \u2013 a way out of the cycle of prostitution and incarceration that had defined her life after a childhood of chaos and abuse", "gt_summaries": "- The information is readily available online: The mugshot of a female inmate, the charges she was convicted on, and her release date. And predators are using it, finds the Guardian in an investigation. It reports that sex traffickers are both wooing \"potential victims while they are still behind bars\" and even preying on them before they get there by manipulating the bail bond system. The Guardian found cases where pimps paid women's bail\u2014alerted to their situation, again, by online records or nefarious bondsmen\u2014only to force them into sex work to \"pay off\" that debt in Florida, Texas, Ohio, North Carolina, and Mississippi. And it's not occasional, according to a former Florida prosecutor who tells the Guardian that all but about 20% of the sex trafficking cases she handled in 2016 involved these bondsmen working with traffickers. For the women already in prison, the traffickers use letters and calls to reel them in. In a companion piece, the Guardian shares Kate's story: While incarcerated at Florida's Lowell Correctional Institution, a stranger named Richard Rawls began to write to her, saying he saw her mugshot online and that it stuck with him. He knew she'd be out soon. He told her to \"come on home to your daddy,\" that he would provide a comfortable home and all the love she needed. Instead, she was taken to a roach-infested house guarded by pit bulls; inside were other former inmates from the same prison. Rawls fed her drugs then demanded she pay him back for them by working as a prostitute. Four months later, she was freed by a SWAT team.

Pete Kostelnick has just made the Greek legend's marathon race look like a quaint sprint. Keeping an average pace of 73 miles per day, the Nebraska ultrarunner, 29, landed at New York City Hall on Monday having raced 3,100 miles from San Francisco in just 42 days, six hours, and 34 minutes, reports the New York Post. He smashed the previous record time for the trek, set by Frank Giannino in 1980, by four days, though Guinness World Records has yet to confirm the time. Kostelnick, who started running several years ago to lose weight, fell twice, per ESPN, but the only real casualties were the eight pairs of shoes he burned through running 15 hours per day, starting at 3:30am, with two 15-minute breaks. A financial planner and two-time winner of the 135-mile Badwater Ultramarathon, per Competitor, Kostelnick drew comparisons to Forrest Gump, not only because of his Bubba Gump hat. Like the fictional character, he was joined by fans\u2014\"awesome people ... [who] drove 10 hours to run with me for 5 miles,\" he says. When he reached Manhattan on Monday to chants of \"run, Pete, run,\" a crowd of 25 was running with him, including men in business suits. \"As with [Tom] Hanks' character, when Kostelnick stopped for a minute, such as to retrieve a dropped water bottle, the crowd stopped. When he moved, they all did,\" per the Post. \"Well, I'm definitely not going to run back,\" Kostelnick said at the finish line. \"All I want is a beer and my wife.\" (A runner just set an Appalachian Trail record.)\n\nThe CIA's Inspector General is calling for the Justice Department to look into allegations that the agency illegally spied on aides to the Senate Intelligence Committee as they gathered information for a potentially contentious report on the CIA's torture program, McClatchy reports. The CIA had insisted that the Intelligence Committee staffers use computers at Agency headquarters to review millions of documents related to its interrogation program. The committee believes the CIA monitored those computers, despite a specific agreement not to, according to McClatchy sources. The 6,000-page report remains classified, but the New York Times notes that it is a \"withering indictment\" of CIA tactics and results. Mark Udall yesterday sent President Obama a letter saying that, \"As you are aware, the CIA has recently taken unprecedented action against the committee,\" without specifying what that action was. Committee chair Dianne Feinstein would confirm only that \"there is an IG investigation.\" The committee has been battling to release its unflattering report, which the agency wants to keep classified. Udall accused the agency in December of withholding an internal review from the committee\u2014and that apparently led the CIA to accuse the committee of gaining unauthorized access to agency databases, leading to this current dispute.\n\nWhile the US has been trying to disgust smokers into giving up tobacco, New Zealand has been considering a more direct idea: raising the price of cigarettes to $100 a pack. The Ministry of Health wants a smoke-free NZ by 2025, and the $100 price tag\u2014which would be implemented by 2020\u2014is one of the ideas being discussed \u2026 although officials admit it is \"probably unrealistic.\" The plan seen as the most likely would make a pack of cigarettes a still-sizable $60 by 2025, Sky News reports.

NASA says its Voyager 1 spacecraft\u2014which launched in 1977\u2014has entered an area of the solar system that scientists didn't know about, the AP reports. \"We do believe this may be the very last layer between us and interstellar space,\" says chief scientist Ed Stone. NASA is calling the region a \"magnetic highway\" where particles from inside the sun's magnetic sphere \"zoom out, and higher-energy particles from outside to stream in.\" Scientists based their conclusion on Voyager's instruments, which show a 1,000-fold decrease in low-energy particles from our solar system and a five-fold jump in high-energy particles from interstellar space, reports Huffington Post. Now Voyager 1 may stay in this in-between zone for two or three years, NASA says. Then comes its future in interstellar space, reports Scientific American: powering down around 2025 and passing a neighboring star in about 40,000 years.

He describes it as a brutally hot day and says that as they stood under the 726-foot-tall structure, he decided, \"F--- it! I'm going for a swim.\" What he didn't know then that he knows now: Some 275 people have died at the dam over the last decade, and no one has successfully made it across the full width of the Colorado River there.

It's a stat made more serious when you consider this next one: 260 million trips are made across the 66,405 problematic bridges each day. As USA Today explains, these bridges aren't necessarily dangerous, they just need a lot of work, which has been priced at $76 billion by the Federal Highway Administration. That amount will just get larger as the years pass. These bridges are, on average, 65 years old, and in 10 years, the number of \"senior citizen\" bridges will be one in four. \"You're seeing the aging of the system,\" says a co-author of the report. \"It really does parallel the [aging of] the Baby Boomers in a startling way.\" Congress recently eliminated a dedicated bridge repair fund, meaning \"bridge repair now must compete with other transportation needs,\" the report states.

Specifically, it requested a list of all employees and contractors who attended the UN's annual global climate talks during the past five years, Reuters reports. The Energy Department responded Tuesday with a refusal. \"We are going to respect the professional and scientific integrity and independence of our employees at our labs and across our department,\" says a department spokesperson, who added that the Trump team's request \"left many in our workforce unsettled.\" Many media outlets are framing the Trump team's request as an attempt to \"purge\" the Energy Department of certain workers. \"We will be forthcoming with all publicly available information with the transition team. We will not be providing any individual names to the transition team,\" the Energy Department spokesperson continued. An official at the Union of Concerned Scientists applauded the Energy Department's response, calling the Trump team's request \"absurd and dangerous,\" and an anonymous Department of Energy employee called the Trump memo \"the first draft of an eventual political enemies list.\" White House spokesperson Josh Earnest said the request for a list of names \"could have been an attempt to target civil servants ... who are critical to the success of the federal government's ability to make policy,\" and a civil service expert tells the Washington Post that even if named employees weren't fired, they could be \"marginalized\" in other ways.

Women will be allowed to undergo the procedure in cases where the mother's life is at risk, including through potential suicide. Abortions due to rape, however, remain banned. The country's parliament voted 127 to 31 to support the new law, which was pushed by prime minister Enda Kenny amid excommunication threats from Catholic leaders. Kenny kicked 74 lawmakers out of his Fine Gael parliamentary group after they voted against the measure, the AP reports. But with some 4,000 Irish women traveling to Britain last year for abortions, critics say the move isn't nearly enough. \"Women pregnant as result of rape, women with fatal fetal anomalies, couples who simply can't afford to care for a (or in most cases, another) child, will still be left behind,\" says an activist.

The victims have begun dipping into the money, which will be split evenly among Gina DeJesus, Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Berry's six-year-old daughter. \"The outpouring of public support has been nothing short of remarkable,\" the victims previously said in a letter via ABC News. \"The community is acting in a way you would hope they would act,\" the fund's co-trustee told Reuters, adding the money will help the women with whatever they need. \"Ten years out of society means not finishing school, no job training, and not learning how to drive.\" It's not only money that's being offered up. Doctors and dentists have volunteered their services, while others have donated the use of vacation homes and cars.

(AP) \u2014 A white South Carolina police officer who claimed he killed a black man in self-defense has been fired and faces murder charges after a bystander's video recorded him firing eight shots at the man's back as he ran away.The video, which was first obtained by The New York Times, picks up after the stop.Slager is seen shooting at Scott eight times as he runs away in a vacant lot.Scott drops to the ground after the last shot and Slager walks over calmly and is shown handcuffing Scott's arms behind his back.Other police officers and later EMS tried to administer CPR but Scott died at the scene, according to an incident report.Police say Slager was carrying a.45-caliber Glock 21 and a Taser X26.The The court Thursday gave the airline a 10,000 euro ($13,021) fine, and obligated it to pay 3,000 euros ($3,902) to Horia Ankour, 30, a nursing student who attempted to fly from France to Israel in April 2012 to participate in a \"Welcome to Palestine\" campaign which saw hundreds of activists seek access to Israel to travel to the Palestinian territories, Radio France Internationale reported Friday.. HAVANA TIMES \u2014 The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) published today a list of 70 artworks recently stolen from the National Museum of Fine Arts in Havana.The theft of the works, mostly belonging to the artistic period known as the \u201cTurn of the Century\u201d on the Caribbean island (the time between 1897 and 1927), was discovered after several pieces were put on sale in Miami, home to the largest Cuban exile community.", "gt_summaries": "- They're not quite working together, but American and Cuban authorities are both looking into the theft of at least 70 artworks from a Havana museum. In the first such heist reported since the 1959 Cuban Revolution, paintings worth a total of around $1.5 million were apparently cut from their frames while in storage at the Cuban capital's National Museum of Fine Arts, reports CNN. The theft was uncovered after Miami art dealer Ramon Cernuda bought a suspicious painting and alerted both the museum and the FBI late last month; the museum then reviewed its archives and confirmed the theft. Cernuda says art theft in Cuba is extremely rare, and it is rarer still for stolen Cuban art to be found in the US. \"The theft is so much more complicated than the smuggling out of Cuba,\" he says. \"To just get the art out of the museum is very complicated.\" Soon after the museum acknowledged the theft, Cuba's minister of culture was fired without explanation, the Havana Times notes. Cernuda says he turned the stolen painting over to the FBI and he believes the agency will hand any recovered artworks back to Havana despite poor US-Cuban relations. \"I am about certain it will go back,\" he says. \"Stolen property is stolen property.\"\n\nA French court has fined Air France nearly $13,000 for removing a pro-Palestinian activist from a flight headed for Tel Aviv, Israel, UPI reports. The airline was also ordered to pay about $3,900 to the passenger, 30-year-old Horia Ankour, who was trying to attend a \"Welcome to Palestine\" event in the Palestinian territories. It all started when an employee on the flight last April asked Ankour whether she had an Israeli passport. Ankour said no, and said no again when asked whether she was Jewish. At that point she was escorted from the plane. French prosecutors argued that Air France had discriminated against Ankour, and the court agreed. Following pressure from Israel, Europe's major airlines canceled about 300 tickets surrounding the pro-Palestinian campaign, AFP reports.\n\nWith protests gaining steam, the city of North Charleston is trying to stay aggressive in its reaction to a white police officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed black man: Officer Michael Slager, who already has been charged with murder, has been fired from the force, the mayor said today. Mayor Keith Summey also announced that every police officer in the city will wear body cameras from now on, reports the Post and Courier. \"I have watched the video and was sickened by what I saw,\" said Police Chief Eddie Diggers of footage of the shooting taken by a bystander. As he spoke at a press conference, the AP reports that protesters interrupted him with chants of \"no justice, no peace.\" \"It looked like he was trying to kill a deer or something, running through the woods,\" Walter Scott Sr., father of the slain Walter Scott, tells NBC. Though Slager has been fired, the city will continue to pay his health insurance for a while because his wife is eight months' pregnant. Meanwhile, the Daily Beast reports that the attorney who initially represented Slager dropped him as a client as soon as video emerged of the shooting\u2014but he's leaving it for others to connect the dots. \"I can't specifically state what is the reason why or what isn't the reason why I'm no longer his lawyer,\" says David Aylor. \"All I can say is that the same day of the discovery of the video that was disclosed publicly, I withdrew as counsel immediately.\""}, {"generated_summaries": "\"I will take my life today around noon,\" she wrote. \"It is time.Dementia is taking its toll and I have nearly lost myself.I have very nearly lost me.\u201d \ud835\udd8a\ud835\udd86\ud835\udd9c\ud835\udd9e\ud835\udd97\ud835\udd98\ud835\udd92\ud835\udd8e\ud835\udd96\ud835\udd95\ud835\udd84\ud835\udd91\ud835\udd99\ud835\udd9a\ud835\udd8f\ud835\udd94\ud835\udd93\ud835\uddae\ud835\uddaf\ud835\udd80\ud835\udd89\ud835\udd8c\ud835\udd81\ud835\udd88\ud835\udd87\ud835\udd8b\ud835\udd9d\ud835\udd82\ud835\udd9b\ud835\udd8d\ud835\udd90\ud835\uddaa\ud835\udda5\ud835\uddba\ud835\udda8\ud835\udda4\ud835\udda6\ud835\uddb9\ud835\udd83\ud835\uddb8\ud835\uddbb\ud835\udd85\ufffd This crawl of online resources of the 115th US Congress was performed on behalf of The United States National Archives & Records Centers for Disease Control recorded 918 cases of syphilis in infants in 2017, a 46% increase on the previous year  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The number of babies born with syphilis is one face of a sexually-transmitted disease (STD) crisis that has worsened across the country, with diagnoses hitting a new record high in 2017..", "gt_summaries": "- An elderly woman, knowing she was suffering from dementia, chose to leave the world on her own terms this week\u2014and she left behind a website calling for the right to physician-assisted suicide.

But some troubling new statistics show that a lot of ground has been lost in the fight against STDs, and it's affecting some of the most vulnerable members of society. According to a new CDC report, 918 babies were born with syphilis in the US in 2017, the Guardian reports. That's a 20-year high. For context, there were 628 cases of syphilis in infants in 2016. In 2013, there were 362. Of the 2017 cases, 77 resulted in stillbirths or newborn deaths, per USA Today. Western and southern states had the most cases of congenital syphilis in 2017, per the report, with Louisiana having the highest rate. \"It's just a systematic public health failure. It's shocking that this has come roaring back in the United States,\" David Harvey of the National Coalition of STD Directors tells the Guardian. Syphilis is easily treated with antibiotics, and women can be treated while they are pregnant to prevent the disease from being passed on to their child. But, per the Guardian, some women do not get tested, and others contract the disease while pregnant after testing negative. In some cases, there is a connection to drug use. Overall, there were 30,644 syphilis diagnoses in the US in 2017\u2014up 76% from the year before.\n\nOne of the two suicide bombers that killed at least 30 people at the Brussels airport Tuesday was the same man who made two of the bombs used in the terrorist attacks on Paris in November, authorities confirmed Friday. The New York Times identified the man as 24-year-old Belgian citizen Najim Laachraoui. Laachraoui's DNA was found on a suicide belt at the Bataclan music venue and an explosive device at the Stade du France following the Paris attacks, NBC News reports. Authorities asked for help finding him on Monday, three days after they arrested Paris attacker and suspected accomplice Salah Abdeslam. On Tuesday, Laachraoui used a bomb hidden in a suitcase to blow himself up at the Brussels airport. Laachraoui left Belgium for Syria in 2013, Reuters reports. His family says it saw no sign of radicalization beforehand and has no idea what happened. Laachraoui's family warned police after he left for Syria. His brother, 20-year-old Mourad, remembers his brother as \"nice\" and \"clever.\" \"Mourad and his whole family are crushed that Najim could have committed such a barbaric act,\" Reuters quotes Mourad's lawyer as saying.

Archaeologists now say they've rediscovered that large sandstone well on a private farm near Liverpool using only a 1983 photo and a description, reports the Liverpool Echo. When archaeologists arrived at the site, there was little evidence of the well at all as \"it had become completely filled with earth,\" says a rep for Historic England. Once excavated, however, it was \"found to be in reasonable condition,\" per an archaeologist. Legend has it that the supposed mother of the Virgin Mary herself descended the medieval well's three steps and bathed in its 4-foot-deep pool, located near a priory of monks, reportedly giving the water the ability to cure eye and skin diseases, per Seeker and ScienceAlert. But the well\u2014believed to have healing properties into the 19th century\u2014also features in a more ominous legend suggesting it's cursed. During a dispute over the well in the 16th century, the prior reportedly cursed the estate manager of a neighboring landowner, whom he believed had a hand in the monastery being seized by the king. The prior said a \"year and a day shall not pass ere St. Anne thy head shall bruise\"\u2014then the prior himself collapsed and died, according to an 1877 newspaper recounting of the legend. The estate manager is said to have disappeared after a night of drinking, only to be found dead in the well with \"his head crushed in.\" ScienceAlert points out the discovery has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Police say Hautzenrader later told them she wasn't aware she was pregnant before entering the bathroom, KCRG reports. Hautzenrader allegedly tried to flush the baby down the toilet because it wasn't crying and she thought it was dead. Police say she then placed it in a pillowcase and put it in the garbage. Hautzenrader cleaned the bathroom and left. A hospital spokesperson says the newborn was found \"shortly after delivery.\" Its current condition is unclear. The hospital won't say if Hautzenrader was a patient or why she was there. She was arrested Monday and charged with child endangerment, a misdemeanor punishable by up to two years in prison.

Competition has already started: Some 32 hours before the opening ceremony, to be exact. The AP reports that early starts are required because Sochi's slate holds a dozen men's and women's medal events added since the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. Everything happening in advance of tomorrow are just qualifying rounds, though. Among them: men's snowboard slopestyle and women's moguls. Security: Everyone is worried about it, and Russia says everyone should chill.

Based on information we received from our intelligence services, there's no reason to believe Sochi is under more threat than any city on the planet.\" He would not, however, comment specifically on... ...Toothpaste bombs: Homeland Security officials yesterday said airlines flying to Russia ahead of the Olympics ought to pay special attention to passengers' toothpaste tubes because they could contain explosives to make a bomb.

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) slammed President Obama's nominee for attorney general Loretta Lynch for her responses at her confirmation hearing to questions on issues like immigration and executive overreach. (AP)", "gt_summaries": "- Today's vote in the Senate to make Loretta Lynch the next attorney general was 56-43. So who was the lone missing senator out of 100? Ted Cruz, which is generating some head scratches considering that he spoke for 10 minutes on the floor of the Senate prior to the vote pleading with his colleagues to reject her. It turns out that Cruz had to catch a flight back to Texas for a fundraiser before the final vote, reports the Dallas Morning News. His spokesperson is downplaying the move, noting that Cruz voted against the procedure for ending a filibuster that cleared the way for a final vote. \"He voted for cloture, that was the vote that mattered,\" says Rick Tyler. \"He made the case against her, he voted against her in cloture, and he didn\u2019t prevail.\" Still, the unusual combination of the presidential candidate blasting Lynch and then being the only senator to skip the vote is making headlines at Politico, BuzzFeed, the Washington Post, and elsewhere. As for Cruz's objection to Lynch, he says she \"embraced the lawlessness\" that marked the tenure of Eric Holder.\n\nThe Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning\u2014though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park. Two hours after protesters defied city hall's order to vacate the park by 12:01am, lawyer and Occupy supporter Jim Lafferty told Reuters he expected police to give the camp a two-day reprieve. At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse. But as of last night, a police inspector said they didn't intend to forcibly evict anyone. \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem,\" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Confrontation is never good.\"\n\nScientists say they have the first physical evidence of a grisly truth from Jamestown: Colonists in the brutal winter of 1609 resorted to cannibalism, reports USA Today. Anthropologists studying the partial remains of a teenage girl\u2014including her skull, jaw, and leg bone\u2014say they bear the unmistakable marks of a cleaver and knife, reports the Washington Post. She had been, for lack of a better word, butchered. \u201cHistorians have to decide whether this type of thing happened,\u201d says one of the Smithsonian scientists who worked on the project. \u201cI think that it did. We didn\u2019t see anybody eat this flesh, but it\u2019s very strong evidence.\u201d It's not clear whether the girl was a servant or perhaps the daughter of a colonist, or whether she was killed to be eaten or eaten after she died. Forensic scientists have re-created her face, though she will likely remain forever unidentified."}]
