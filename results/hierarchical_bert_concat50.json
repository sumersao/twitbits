The once undermanned and outgunned Ukrainian force is now noticeably better armed, using buses and pickup trucks alongside its armored vehicles to transport what the Telegraph describes as a \"motley mix\" of police, special forces, and militiamen. Ukraine says it has succeeded in sealing the Russian border, preventing troops and weapons from flowing to the rebels. But Vladimir Putin has been suspiciously silent, ignoring the separatists' increasingly urgent pleas for help, and many are speculating that he aims to cut his losses, having already taken the real prize of Crimea, the Wall Street Journal reports. Observers believe Moscow has ruled out any military intervention, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov struck a decidedly peaceful tone at a news conference, saying, \"A quick end to the bloodshed is in our common interest.\" But one US official cautioned against declaring victory. \"There is only one person who knows what Putin is planning,\" he said, \"and that is Putin.\"\n\nWeird news from the land of Charlie Sheen: The troubled actor has managed to irk a group of 9/11 truthers, which is now threatening to protest in front of his live shows.

But as they made to drive off, a gunman approached the passenger door, demanded money, and murdered his wife. Now, 24 years later, a jury has decided who was responsible for Vicki Ghonim's death: then-19-year-old Morrad Ghonim. The 43-year-old, who was extradited from Antigua last year, was on Monday found guilty of first-degree murder. The man who pulled the trigger, however, was Leon Martinez. Police got to Martinez by way of grant money earmarked for cold cases, reports the Whittier Daily News.

John Lasseter, 61, has been on leave from parent company Disney since November after allegations of improper workplace behavior surfaced, including his propensity to wrap up everyone he meets in long bear hugs. Disney announced Friday that Lasseter\u2014who previously acknowledged and apologized for his \"missteps\"\u2014will shift into a vague consulting role through the end of the year and then depart for good, reports the New York Times. Disney execs were wrestling for months with whether to allow Lasseter to return, but Deadline reports on a \"gathering sense\" among employees that he would not have been welcome. Disney chief Bob Iger issued a statement that praised Lasseter for \"reinventing the animation business, taking breathtaking risks, and telling original, high quality stories that will last forever,\u201d and Lasseter issued one of his own thanking Disney and saying he's \"extremely proud\" of his work but that it's time to move on.

Martin Bailey says Van Gogh didn't take a razor to his ear because of an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, though the two did quarrel that day in 1888, the Guardian reports. Instead, Van Gogh cut his ear off because he had learned that his brother, Theo, was going to get married, Bailey says. He says the struggling artist feared that the marriage would end his close relationship with his brother\u2014and that it would cause Theo to cut off the financial support Van Gogh relied on. Bailey says that Van Gogh didn't learn of the engagement while he was recovering in hospital, as previously thought, but in a letter that was delivered to him in Provence just hours before the self-mutilation. \"Had Van Gogh been elated by the engagement, it is virtually inconceivable that he would have sliced off part of his ear a few hours after receiving Theo\u2019s news, whatever other difficulties he was facing,\" Bailey writes in new book Studio of the South, per the Telegraph.

Their daughter canceled her Georgia wedding with just 40 days' notice, and the venue, food, and entertainment were already paid for. Then Willie had \"a vision,\" his wife tells ABC News. \"I was in the process of canceling out the venue and he said, 'No, what we'll do is donate it to Hosea Feed the Hungry.'\" Their daughter had volunteered for the organization, which helps homeless people in the Atlanta area, when she was younger. And that's how, on Sept. 15, the Fowler Family Celebration of Love was born. Two hundred guests were bused to Villa Christina for a four-course meal complete with coconut shrimp and salmon (the 50 kids in attendance got chicken fingers). The family hopes to get sponsors and make it an annual event, Carol tells WBUR. A rep for Hosea Feed the Hungry said the nonprofit initially thought the Fowlers were pulling their leg: \"It's a very creme de la creme wedding venue, so to say that you're going to host 200 homeless individuals at Villa Christina\u2014it sounds like a prank call.\" The Fowlers' daughter attended the event, and her dad says it was a \"bittersweet but rewarding\" experience; her mom tells Today Tamara found it \"surreal but incredibly rewarding.\" Carol has this advice: \"If you have canceled an event, do not walk away. Pick up the phone and call your favorite charity and offer it to them. We're regular, working people and anybody can do this.

On Sept. 13\u2014a day after remarking that she'd come across dozens of men in motor boats armed with arrows and rifles near Coari, an area known to be frequented by river pirates and drug traffickers\u2014Kelty sent out a distress signal and then went silent, reports the Guardian.

The footage, which appears to be from a motion-activated camera at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Rosemont, Ill, doesn't capture the moment the 19-year-old entered the freezer, but it shows her walking, alone and apparently disoriented, through a disused hotel kitchen on the way there, reports the Chicago Tribune.

But last month's budget contained language that forces the government to plan for restarting these paper mailings. Ridiculous? Not according to a group called Consumers for Paper Options, which lobbied for that change and has since 2010 been \"advocating for access to paper-based services and information,\" as the group puts it. But though the group says it's a \"coalition of individuals and organizations,\" it's actually a product of the paper industry, the Washington Post reports: It was established by the Envelope Manufacturers Association and gets funding from the top paper-industry trade group. The Treasury expects to save $1 billion over a decade following its 2013 move to largely paperless communications, noting that processing a paper check costs $1.25, which is $1.16 cents more than the cost of an electronic payment. (It hasn't stopped paper mailings to the elderly and people with \"mental impairments,\" the Post notes.) But \"if there are Americans who can't use an iPhone to navigate the Internet, there ought to be an option for them,\" says a rep for Consumers for Paper Options, noting that a quarter of the US lacks Internet access. He also cites a study that says 73% of adults don't believe they should have to deal with the government online. That study was run by the group. A recent op-ed in Roll Call signed by a pair of congressmen also pushed for paper; it turns out Consumers for Paper Options was involved in that piece, too.

The Wisconsin State Journal reports on the unidentified 32-year-old man at the center of it all, showing up Tuesday at a Madison police station to turn himself in for what he'd intended to do: take pictures up women's skirts by using a shoe camera. The Washington Post notes it's not exactly clear what a \"shoe camera\" is, but the man apparently was able to attach some kind of photographic device to his shoe and was testing it at home when the battery exploded, injuring his foot, Officer David Dexheimer tells the Journal. After getting treatment for the minor burns he received from the mini-blast, the man confessed his unsavory intentions to a clergyman, who encouraged him to turn himself in to police, Dexheimer says. There's a Wisconsin law on the books that outlaws anyone from purposely installing a device to photograph or otherwise record under a person's clothes without that person's consent, but the man in this case caught a lucky break: Per Madison Police Chief Mike Koval's daily \"significant calls\" blog, \"the subject was counseled on his actions and released from the scene as no illicit video had been taken.\" Koval notes there is an ongoing investigation, however.

Instead, the party won an outright majority, taking 326 of 650 seats.

Two big ones: Expect to start reading the word \"Brexit\" much more often, with Cameron having vowed to hold a 2017 referendum on whether the UK should remain a part of the EU. And could Scotland leave Britain? CNN presents the possibility, noting that the Scottish National Party's victory was a staggering one, with it taking 56 out of the 59 UK parliamentary seats in Scotland. CNN points to \"rumblings in the British press\" that such an SNP victory could spur yet another referendum, this one in 2016, on a split. The view from Michael Wolff: \"It might be argued that the Cameron government's campaign last year to defeat the referendum for Scottish independence helped propel the popularity of the SNP, which in turn undermined the Labour Party's traditional strength in Scotland, thereby helping to [ensure] the Tory victory,\" he writes in USA Today.

The New York Times reports those videos, shot by overheard aircraft on March 4, 2002, may show Air Force Technical Sergeant John Chapman fighting al-Qaeda militants and killing two while alone on a mountaintop in Afghanistan. What's so shocking about the footage is not just the bravery. It's that Chapman was supposed to be dead. He was originally there with members of SEAL Team 6, providing support as their radioman. In the midst of a fierce and disastrous operation, Senior Chief Petty Officer Britt Slabinski determined the men needed to get off the mountain. Slabinski couldn't verify the wounded Chapman was dead, but he was nearly certain. So a \"dead\" Chapman was left behind. The Air Force now suspects Chapman was alive for roughly another hour and tried to provide cover for a helicopter carrying Army Ranger reinforcements (three Rangers were among seven Americans to die that day; some say blame rests at the SEALs' feet). The conclusion comes thanks to technology that assigns those on the ground a pixel signature that can be tracked even when ground cover blocks a man from view. The Air Force secretary wants Chapman given the Medal of Honor; SEAL Team 6 has no issue with that, but hasn't taken a stance on whether Chapman was alive. Slabinski is outwardly skeptical, and suggests the Air Force would welcome a Medal of Honor, which it hasn't seen one of its own get since Vietnam. But a fresh look at Chapman's autopsy may provide further proof he was alive.

Of the 65 people who attended the baby's funeral, 15 contracted the deadly disease and at least 11 of them have died, AP reports. The outbreak has killed at least 16 people so far, and the hospital at the center of the outbreak is now dealing with 30 more suspected cases, including five from a prison, reports CNN. The government has urged Ugandans to avoid handshakes, casual sex, and home funerals, Reuters reports.

In the speech to Al Sharpton's National Action Network, Mediaite reports that Holder went off script with these lines: \u201cThe last five years have been defined by significant strides and by lasting reforms even in the face, even in the face of unprecedented, unwarranted, ugly and divisive adversity.

What attorney general has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment? What president has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment?\u201d Holder was apparently referring to a heated exchange he had with Republican Louie Gohmert of Texas as he testified before the House Judiciary Committee. Real Clear Politics has the transcript: Gohmert: \u201cI realize that contempt is not a big deal to our attorney general. But it is important that we have proper oversight ...\" Holder: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go there, buddy. You don\u2019t want to go there, OK?\u201d Gohmert: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go there? ... About the contempt?\u201d Holder: \"No. You should not assume that that is not a big deal to me. I think it was inappropriate. I think it was unjust. But never think that that was not a big deal to me. Don\u2019t ever think that.\u201d The Washington Post notes that Holder also muttered, \"Good luck with your asparagus\" to Gohmert, a reference to yet another nasty exchange between the two last year. Back then, an annoyed Gohmert apparently misspoke, asserting that \"the attorney general will not cast aspersions on my asparagus.\u201d Gohmert wasn't Holder's only critic at yesterday's hearing.

Police say the 22-year-old man at first fled before approaching officers while holding an \"object\" that he \"extended in front of him.\" Police say the officers thought it was a gun and, fearing for their safety, opened fire on Clark. Police initially said the object turned out to be a \"tool bar\" of some kind only to later revise that: Clark was apparently holding only a cellphone.

Officers briefly confiscated a handgun from Zimmerman, who was acquitted last year in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, but returned it to him, shook hands, and sent him on his way. The incident began Tuesday morning, when 35-year-old Matthew Apperson made a U-turn on Lake Mary Boulevard and a truck soon pulled up alongside.

Instead, teams can now simply signal the ump that a walk is in the works, and the runner can immediately saunter over to first. This change could shave 14.3 seconds off of each game, per estimates by the Wall Street Journal.

The far-right and conspiracy theorist publications found in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's apartment appear to have been supplied by an elderly man befriended by the brothers through their mother's job as a home health aide, the Wall Street Journal finds. A lawyer for the family of Donald Larking, a 67-year-old who suffered brain damage when he was shot in a robbery 40 years ago, says Larking was obsessed with conspiracy theories and shared publications with the brothers that questioned the Holocaust and accused the US or Israeli governments of being behind 9/11 and the Newtown school shooting. Larking also supplied the brothers with copies of a white supremacist newspaper published in Alabama. He became so close to Tamerlan that he converted to Islam and began attending the local mosque with him, says the lawyer, who stresses that the shooting badly impaired the elderly man's \"awareness of the realities of the world\" and his ability to make decisions, the AP reports. Larking, who still attends the mosque, has sunk into \"depression and anger\" since the Boston Marathon bombing and believes his friends were the victims of another conspiracy, the lawyer says.\n\nA 21-year-old Baltimore County man died in the hospital three days after being repeatedly punched by officers responding to his 911 call, the Guardian reports.

Essentially, \"it's a very basic form of word generation,\" researcher Andy Russell tells the BBC. The team started out by listening to chestnut-crowned babbler birds. Rather than sing, they produce \"discrete calls made up of smaller, acoustically distinct individual sounds,\" an expert says in a press release. Two sounds, identified as \"A\" and \"B,\" kept getting repeated. For example, the birds used an \"AB\" call to tell other birds where they were while in flight (listening birds would look to the sky), while a \"BAB\" call told chicks it was feeding time (listening birds would look at nests). Rearranging the sounds of the flight call to produce the latter call showed no alteration in the birds' behavior, and vice versa, proving the individual sounds were in fact the same. \"Although the two babbler bird calls are structurally very similar, they are produced in totally different behavioral contexts and listening birds are capable of picking up on this,\" a researcher explains. Russell adds, per the Christian Science Monitor, the babblers may communicate this way because it's easier to swap existing sounds than make up new ones. What's perhaps most fascinating is that researchers believe the birds' \"B\" sound differentiates the meaning of the call. In other words, it's the \"c\" that discerns the words \"cat\" and \"at\" in the English language. Such distinguishing elements are called phonemes, and this basic example \"might help us understand how the ability to generate new meaning initially evolved in humans,\" an expert says. \"It could be that when phoneme structuring first got off the ground in our hominid ancestors, this is the form it initially took.\" Russell says the ability likely exists in other animals.

But it was her bank account, not her phone, that was hacked, so the incident falls outside Operation Weeting, Scotland Yard\u2019s phone hacking investigation. Middleton\u2019s account was allegedly accessed in 2005 by Jonathan Rees, a private detective who had worked for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News of the World tabloid, the Telegraph reports. Rees also targeted Tony Blair and other high-profile victims, a member of parliament told the House of Commons yesterday. The MP wants the phone hacking inquiry expanded, and the Metropolitan Police force is considering investigating the new allegations. Rees was hired by NOTW first in the 1990s and again in 2004, after serving prison time for a drug conspiracy charge, but the tabloid\u2019s parent company notes that Rees worked for a number of other newspapers as well.

That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book\u2014Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.\u201d\n\nGolf may be \"a good walk, spoiled,\" but at least it doesn't spoil your life expectancy. In fact, a new study finds that heavy cardio sports like cycling and rowing do nothing to help you live longer than playing golf or cricket, reports the Wall Street Journal. Researchers looked at mortality rates in 9,889 Olympic athletes who completed from 1896 to 1936 in 43 types of sports, and surprisingly found that those who competed in intense activities did not live any longer than those who curled, shot guns, played cricket, or golfed. \"Engaging in cycling and rowing (high cardiovascular intensity) had no added survival benefit compared with playing golf or cricket (low cardiovascular intensity),\" says the study. One theory is that intensive exercise over the long-term also leads to injuries and damage that balance out the benefits of such exercise. \"Over time, this will result in an accumulation of damage, which can be explained as a form of aging,\" says a study author.

John Podesta told CNN's State of the Union that Comey should have reviewed the information more thoroughly before making the decision public. Now, Podesta says, Comey should explain why \"he took this unprecedented step, particularly when he said himself in the letter to the Hill that these (emails) may not even be significant.\" The candidate herself kept up the attack on Comey, notes CNN, telling a crowd on Saturday that \"it's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election. In fact, it's not just strange, it's unprecedented and it's deeply troubling because voters deserve to get full and complete facts.\" Elsewhere: Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says Comey was between a rock and a hard place, and could have been accused of meddling with the election if he hadn't made the disclosure. Meanwhile, Team Trump is walking back its previous criticism of the FBI's handling of the investigation into Clinton's email. Tim Kaine says Comey needs to tell the public if he hasn't yet reviewed any of the emails considered \"pertinent\" to the investigation, and says that as far as the campaign knows, Comey \"knows nothing about the content of these emails.\" He calls it a \"distraction\" but says the Clinton campaign will \"power forward\" during the last 10 days. Mike Pence says the scandal shows that Clinton is \"just a risky choice in this election.\" He adds that Trump has \"made it clear we'll have the resources we need,\" and praises his \"incredible generosity.\" Clinton's close relationship with top aide Huma Abedin is being put to the test, reports the New York Times.

Of course, getting him confirmed is another issue, and the Hill digs into the political logistics in the Senate. Republicans have the numbers, but two wild cards are Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: At Vox, Ezra Klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an \"insane\" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the White House and the other the Senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? Reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty.

A witness says that after the boy fell 15 feet into in the enclosure, the gorilla seemed protective at first, but he became agitated as visitors screaming and started dragging the boy through a moat. A witness tells CNN that to get into the enclosure when his mother was distracted, the boy had to \"climb under something, through some bushes and then into the moat.\" He was released from a hospital on Saturday night and his parents issued a statement thanking the zoo and saying the boy is \"doing just fine,\" the Cincinnati Enquirer reports. \"We know that this was a very difficult decision for them, and that they are grieving the loss of their gorilla,\" they said.

And she speared new conservative super PACs designed to weed out more conservative candidates for more electable ones.

Justice only joined the Democratic Party in 2015 to run for governor. He had been a registered Independent and Republican prior to that and even donated to the Republican Governors' Association a few years before his run as a Democrat. He's also friends with the Trump family and Sen. Mitch McConnell. Plus, the ever-more conservative West Virginia is a hotbed of Trump support.

The Telegraph resurfaces the remarkable story of Hessy Taft (born Hessy Levinsons), a now 80-year-old who in 1935, at just six months, was taken by her mother to a Berlin photographer to have her baby photo taken. Months later, Pauline Levinsons spied her daughter's photo on the cover of the Nazi magazine Sonne ins Hause. Worried their Jewish identity would surface as a result, she hurried back to Hans Ballin, who explained to her that he \"wanted to make the Nazis ridiculous\"\u2014and so the photographer intentionally entered the young Hessy into a contest looking for the most beautiful Aryan baby, one thought to be judged by Joseph Goebbels himself. The truth of the baby's identity never came to light, though Hessy was kept out of public sight by her parents, who feared she'd be recognized. A short time later the family fled Germany for Latvia, then Paris, Cuba, and finally the United States. Haaretz points out that Taft's story isn't an untold one: In fact, it's published on the US Holocaust Memorial Museum website. But it's getting a fresh look after Taft recently gave Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial a copy of the magazine cover. \"I feel a little revenge,\" the Telegraph quotes her as saying. \"Something like satisfaction.\" (In other Nazi news: Was Hitler a billionaire tax dodger?)\n\nA top fundraiser for President Trump has resigned from the Republican National Committee following a report that he paid $1.6 million to a Playboy playmate he had an affair with. Elliott Broidy told RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel Friday that he was resigning immediately, an RNC official familiar with the discussion tells the AP. The resignation comes after the Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen helped negotiate a non-disclosure agreement between Broidy and the model last year. The unidentified playmate elected to have an abortion after discovering she was pregnant. \u201cIt is unfortunate that this personal matter between two consenting adults is the subject of national discussion just because of Michael Cohen\u2019s involvement,\u201d Broidy said in a statement. Broidy, who is based in Los Angeles, had been deputy national finance chairman for the RNC, reports the Washington Post. Under the deal negotiated by Cohen between the married Broidy and the Playmate, the woman agreed to never discuss the relationship or she would have to forfeit the money.

The fight is between a spam-fighting group, Spamhaus, and a web-hosting company, Cyberbunker, but it has grown to the point that it's affecting the entire Internet and its infrastructure. Millions of users are experiencing delays while trying to reach websites or while using services like Netflix, and experts fear that if the attacks continue to grow in power, people may not be able to access things like email or online banking. It all started when Spamhaus, which publishes a blacklist that email providers use to weed out spam, put Cyberbunker on its list of spammers. Cyberbunker retaliated, but its attack on Spamhaus ended up having a much larger impact. One architect at a digital content provider likened it to, as the New York Times puts it, using a machine gun in an effort to assassinate one person. The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks \"are essentially like nuclear bombs\" that exploit the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS), says an exec at a group that tried to defend against the attacks and ended up becoming a target. \"It's so easy to cause so much damage.\" And, notes the architect, this is \"the largest publicly announced DDoS attack in the history of the Internet.\" Cyberbunker says Spamhaus is a vigilante group \"abusing [its] influence,\" but the architect notes that Cyberbunker is \"just mad\" that it got caught spamming. One security researcher says the only way to stop the attack is to arrest the people responsible. Five cyber-police forces around the globe are investigating.\n\nOne more for the gold, and seemingly nothing can prevent it.

Though the topic seems destined for the courts, the FCC's decision \"is going to be a benchmark,\" a researcher tells USA Today. The board is expected to approve chairman Tom Wheeler's guidelines to regulate the Internet like a utility, as President Obama suggested. His proposal also labels broadband providers as \"common carriers\" under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, which means the FCC could prohibit paid prioritization for \"fast lanes,\" NBC News reports. What does that mean for you? \"All this ruling means is that there will be FCC jurisdiction to examine practices and hear complaints,\" a legal professor explains. He bats down claims that this is \"an all-or-nothing decision that will transform the Internet,\" suggesting much is still to be determined. \"Your broadband will still cost the same amount as it did before.\" Essentially Wheeler's rules would mean Internet service providers must treat all traffic equally, which is why Netflix\u2014which claims almost 35% of peak traffic in the US\u2014supports the move. It can't be charged more for the bandwidth it uses. Companies like Etsy, Kickstarter, Tumblr, and Vimeo support rules similar to Wheeler's. In the past, so did Google. But nearly a decade after Google and Facebook first pushed for new rules, the search giant has urged the FCC to draft rules boosting investment in broadband Internet networks, as have net neutrality opponents AT&T and Comcast, the Wall Street Journal reports. An expert predicts the \"public utility-style regulations\" will \"create a tremendous amount of chaos\" for cable and Internet companies, particularly when it comes to addressing congestion. They would have to ensure their practices of freeing up bandwidth are \"reasonable,\" NPR reports. The rules also include what's called \"zero-rating,\" which is when an app or group of apps\u2014for example T-Mobile's Music Freedom plan\u2014isn't counted against a user's data cap. Sounds like a bonus, right? \"That distorts competition,\" says one expert. Republicans generally consider Wheeler's rules a government power grab. Congress could respond with legislation that undercuts Wheeler's guidelines, but Obama would likely veto.\n\nA cool, spaceship-like catamaran dropped anchor in Monaco yesterday after completing the first-ever round-the-world trip by a solar-powered vessel, the LA Times reports.

Four members of the Wagner family were arrested Tuesday, and authorities say a custody dispute played a role in the murders, the AP reports. Edward \"Jake\" Wagner, now 26, was the ex-boyfriend of Hanna Rhoden, 19, who was killed while lying in bed with her 4-day-old baby girl. Wagner was not the newborn's father, but shared custody of another daughter, Sophia, now 5, with Rhoden. Sophia was not with her mother when she was murdered; the newborn as well as two of her young cousins who were present were not hurt. (This chart shows how all the victims were related.) Also arrested, per Cincinnati.com: Wagner's parents George \"Billy\" Wagner III, 47, and Angela Wagner, 48, and his brother George Wagner IV, 27. All four have been charged with eight counts of aggravated murder and also face a slew of other charges. The mothers of both elder Wagners were also arrested and accused of forging custody documents in an alleged cover-up of the crimes. Citing a \"fixation\" and \"obsession\" the Wagner family allegedly had with the custody situation, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said Tuesday the situation is \"the most bizarre story I've ever seen. It's just amazing.\" Authorities say the Wagners knew the Rhodens well and spent months studying their routines and the layouts of their homes. But the Wagners have long denied involvement and insisted they were close friends with the Rhodens; they moved to Alaska after the killings due, they said, to intense speculation over their possible involvement in the case. \"Sophia is getting older,\" Jake Wagner (who also set up a GoFundMe for custody-related legal bills in the wake of the massacre) said at the time, so they moved \"so she wouldn\u2019t hear it.\" They were arrested, however, in Ohio and Kentucky.

The donor heart was damaged and weakened as a result and wouldn't strengthen; it was eventually swapped for an artificial heart.

Things have gone downhill from there. But amid poverty and heroin woes, the city of 21,000 has \"turned for the worst,\" Jessica Sayre tells the Washington Post. Her 26-year-old sister, Tiffany, a sex worker battling a drug problem, went missing from a local motel on May 11. Her naked body was found wrapped in a sheet in a drainage pipe on Saturday, making her the fourth woman to turn up dead near Chillicothe's waterways in the last year.

Researchers have presented a small study suggesting for the first time that air pollutants can make their way from a pregnant woman's lungs to her placenta, reports the Guardian. Because the placenta allows nutrients and oxygen to flow from the woman's blood stream to her fetus, that means it could similarly allow pollutants into the womb as well, per CNN. \"Our evidence suggests that this is indeed possible,\" says Norrice Liu, a pediatrician who led the research at Queen Mary University in London. \"We also know that the particles do not need to get into the baby's body to have an adverse effect, because if they have an effect on the placenta, this will have a direct impact on the fetus.\" The study, presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Paris, was indeed small, involving just five women. But researchers found \"black sooty\" particles, believed to be carbon, in the placentas of each one, says another of the researchers, Lisa Miyashita. Further analysis is in the works to confirm, but the results mirror similar ones in animals. Given previous research laying out the potential dangers that air pollution can cause to babies, the scientists say the study should factor into the advice given to pregnant women, even if it's as simple as wearing a mask or avoiding especially busy roads when out and about. The good news: All five of the women gave birth to healthy babies. (Air pollution might be the world's greatest killer.)\n\nThe Southern Avenger rides alone once more.

She apparently decided to go for it, however, and to tell her fans in the interest of \"candor\"\u2014and so everyone would quit bugging her about whether she'd had it done or not. \"So all of you can stop staring,\" she writes. \"You want to know, so now you know.

Rather than electronically identifying offensive images, for instance, the company says it has actual human beings assess context, the New York Times reports. Today, the site is posting a more thorough explanation of its policies, which also address matters ranging from hate speech and nudity to issues of intellectual property. It encourages users to flag content that concerns them. Among its examples: Nudity: Genitals are a no-no. But while, for example, some images of breasts won't be tolerated, pictures of breastfeeding or mastectomy scars are allowed, as is artwork showing nudes, a spokeswoman tells the paper. Violence: The site has gone back and forth on beheading videos, finally settling on a ban, the Times reports. But images of violence may be allowed if they're aimed at sharing \"information about atrocities in the world.\" Hate speech: Race-, gender-, and religion-based attacks won't be tolerated, the site says. But \"people can use Facebook to challenge ideas, institutions, and practices,\" the site notes. \"Such discussion can promote debate and greater understanding.\" International differences: The laws of different countries can change what's acceptable where. Facebook points to its Global Government Requests Report as a source of information on how official policies affect content and privacy. In the second half of 2014, the site notes, 9,707 pieces of content were restricted by governments, up 11% from the first half of the year.

That's nearly five hours of personal phone time a week, and a total of more than eight hours of broader personal time, notes WTOP. Not only that, but most bosses underestimate the time waste on phones to be closer to 39 minutes a day\u2014and workers younger than 35 are averaging a whopping 70 minutes of their day on their phones and 48 minutes on other personal matters. \"It's understandable that employees may occasionally use their mobile devices or attend to personal tasks during business hours,\" OfficeTeam's' district president says. \"But these activities can easily become big distractions.\" Fortune reports that most of the personal time on phones is spent on social media and non-work email; in distant third, fourth, and fifth places come sports sites, mobile gaming, and shopping.

The researchers say the rate of ice loss has tripled over the last decade and the melting ice sheets are now pushing up sea levels around the world by around a half-millimeter every year, reports the BBC. Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the West Antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \"state of collapse\"\u2014and modest ice growth in the East Antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \"The increasing mass loss that they\u2019re finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the West Antarctic, the area that\u2019s changing most rapidly,\" University of Waterloo glaciologist Christine Dow tells the Washington Post. \"And it\u2019s the area that we\u2019re most worried about, because it\u2019s below sea level.\" Antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \"I think we should be worried. That doesn't mean we should be desperate,\" says study co-author Isabella Velicogna of the University of California Irvine, per the AP. \"Things are happening. They are happening faster than we expected.\"\n\nCoach will spend $2.4 billion for Kate Spade, tying together two premier brands in the luxury goods sector in a bid to snare younger shoppers. Noting that crucial demographic, Coach CEO Victor Luis says in a company release Monday that Kate Spade has a \"strong awareness among consumers, especially millennials.\" Coach will pay $18.50 per share of Kate Spade, a 9% premium to its Friday closing price of $16.97. It follows another recent millennial-minded deal on Coach's part: engaging Selena Gomez (and, it likely hopes, her 120 million Instagram fans) in a deal that will put her in Coach ads and across its social media, reports CNBC. But the brand isn't just going younger, it's going luxe-er, reports the AP: Coach has made an aggressive push to polish its image as a purveyor of opulence, ending many of the promotions it had used to ramp up sales. To power future growth, it's begun to build an empire of luxury brands. In 2015, Coach acquired the high-end footwear company Stuart Weitzman. Last month the company hired Joshua Schulman, the president of Neiman Marcus's Bergdorf Goodman division, and put him in the newly created position as president and CEO of the Coach brand.

The fixes aren't exactly high-tech: North Korean soldiers were seen digging a big trench in the border area where the soldier first drove and then ran to freedom, reports Reuters. They also planted trees, apparently to prevent vehicles from getting through in the future. Finally, North Korea also seems to have replaced all of its border security guards, reports the Yonhap news agency, which surmises that any officers involved are in for serious punishment. Details and developments: The soldier: \"He's a pretty nice guy,\" the lead South Korean surgeon says of the 24-year-old defector, identified only by the name \"Oh.\" The patient likes Bruce Almighty and CSI, though USA Today notes it's unclear whether he saw that US movie and show in the hospital or previously in North Korea on the black market. Oh faces a long recuperation, having been shot at least five times. One bullet decimated his colon.

Lee is the one giving regular updates after the surgeries he performs, and the Washington Post reports that he previously became a \"national hero\" in 2011 when he saved the life of a ship captain shot by Somali pirates. That feat became the subject of a medical drama. Lee, blind in one eye, also served as the inspiration for a character in a second drama called Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim, which was released last year and gave him certifiable celeb status. The Post uses the terms \"heartthrob\" and \"McDreamy\" in the profile. Next for Oh: The surgeon, taking note of Oh's \"jarhead\" haircut, jokingly suggested that Oh eventually join the South Korean military: \"He smiled and said that he would never ever go back to the military system again.\" When he's stronger, Oh will be debriefed. Then he'll get help with housing, education, and job training from the South Korean government, reports the Guardian.\n\nMore bad news for President Obama on ObamaCare today: The House passed legislation widely seen as undermining the health-care law, and 39 Democrats joined Republicans in favor, reports the Washington Post. The bill from Michigan Republican Fed Upton would guarantee that people whose policies got canceled under ObamaCare would be able to keep them. President Obama addressed the problem yesterday with an administrative fix, but Upton's bill goes further. While the president's fix says the plans can remain available for only another year, Upton's measure seeks to keep them around permanently, reports the Hill.

The Rabbs' fringe-limbed tree frog wasn't even discovered until 2005 when scientists were attempting to rescue specimens of any amphibian they could before a deadly chytrid fungal infection hit Panama. According to National Geographic, Toughie made it out of Panama, but it's estimated that the chytrid fungus killed up to 85% of all amphibians left behind in his natural habitat. He had lived in isolation at the Garden since 2008. A cause of death is unknown, but Toughie was believed to be at least 12 years old. In his final years, Toughie became a \"symbol of the extinction crisis.\" His photo was projected onto St. Peter's Basilica, and he was visited by film directors and race car drivers. \"A lot of people were moved to tears when they saw him,\" a photographer who worked with Toughie says. \"When you have the very last of something it's a special deal.\u201d While some scientists are holding out hope for the Rabbs' tree frog, it's likely Toughie was the last, Scientific American reports.

She's a biologist in British Columbia who was willing to tolerate 180,000 bites as a host for the creatures so that her team could study them. \"I calmed myself down thinking when human beings were still living in caves, they were probably bitten by bedbugs, by fleas, by mice and who knows what,\" she tells the Canadian Press via CTV. \"So I think humans can endure this, and I'm lucky enough that I have no side effects, that I just can handle it.\" It seems her work has paid off. The researchers, including Gries' husband, found a histamine molecule that, to the bugs, indicates a \"safe space,\" the Press reports; once the bugs find it, they stick around. The researchers lured them to the trap using a pheromone blend and components from the bedbugs' own feces; the histamine then keeps them there. The cost of the chemicals? Less than a dime per trap. \"The biggest challenge in dealing with bedbugs is to detect the infestation at an early stage,\" Gries' husband tells Simon Fraser University News. \"This trap will help landlords, tenants, and pest-control professionals determine whether premises have a bedbug problem, so that they can treat it quickly.\" The trap should be on the market next year, CBC reports. That's particularly good news for Chicago, which was reported earlier this year to be America's worst city for bedbugs.

Officials believe the insurgents disguised themselves as women in order to get weapons into the building, which is under construction, the Washington Post adds. \"We strongly believe they used burkas,\" which were found inside the van alongside the assailants' weapons, \"to reach this place,\" a police spokesperson says. \"The police respect the women too much.\" Though the attack raises concerns about Kabul's vulnerability and security shortcomings as US forces start withdrawing from Afghanistan, US Ambassador Ryan Crocker downplayed it, calling it simply \"harassment.\" He continues, \"If this is the best they can do, I find their lack of ability and capacity and the ability of Afghan forces to respond to it, actually encouraging.\" Crocker tells the New York Times today that the Pakistan-based Haqqani group appeared to be behind the assault."}, {"generated_summaries": ["These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.The goal is to fix all broken links on the web.", "After an argument, one fed-up mother in Brampton, Ont., decided to give her 23-year-old son who lives at home a wake-up call by invoicing him for more than $39,000.Chalipo\u2019s mom addressed the invoice to her \u201cUnappreciative Son\u201d and wrote that it was \u201cfor services delivered free of charge in the last 13 months ALONE (except for Tuition \u2013 which is 5 years).\u201d The bill came to a grand total of $39254.17.Among the more notable expenses on the bill: a $1,000 fee for \u201cbeing an a**hole and not appreciative of your mother's support financially or otherwise.\u201d\u201cShe was being generous so I could be generous,\u201d Chal", "\"We estimate that many millions of sharks are killed annually through both legal and illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing for the trade in fins, the prime ingredient in shark fin soup,\" said Dr. Rachel Graham, director of WCS's Gulf and Caribbean Sharks and Rays Program. \"The high price for fins has caused the global shark fishery to expand far beyond what is sustainable.

The pair clearly disagreed, so his mom drew up an invoice\u2014including $23,550 for college tuition, $1,200 for specialty meals, an $187.20 share of the cable bill, and $1,000 \"for being an a--hole and not appreciative of your mother's support financially or otherwise\"\u2014adding up to $39,254.17 after she applied 13% tax.

The post quickly went viral. \"I thought it was one of those things that everyone would appreciate and get a good laugh out of it ... but I didn't know that it would make international headlines,\" Chalipo adds. His mom admits she never expected her son to pay the bill. \"It was intended to be tongue-in-cheek, although obviously I was a little annoyed by him,\" she says. \"It was really just to prove a point and to make him wake up.\" It worked. \"This was a very effective parenting technique and it has helped me to realize what an entitled little s--- I have been,\" Chalipo writes on Reddit. He also plans to make it up to his mom eventually. \"My mom will get old one day and I'll take care of her and spend years and years repaying her, even changing her diapers,\" Chalipo says.

Police say the 50-year-old, who has a developmental delay and functions at a child's level, has spent the last 30 years living in St. Catharines, around 80 miles from where he disappeared, CTV reports. From what investigators can piece together, Latulip took a bus to Niagara Falls in September 1986 and ended up in St. Catharines, where he suffered a head injury and \"effectively forgot who he was\" until this year, when he told a social worker he remembered. Before his disappearance, Latulip had attempted suicide at least once, leading to fears he may have killed himself. Police officer Duane Gingerich, who investigated the disappearance, tells the Guelph Mercury that he's thrilled that Latulip has turned up alive. \"I had hopes that he was out there somewhere,\" he says. \"For us as investigators, this is great, this is awesome. It's satisfying because most of these cases don't turn out this way. You expect the worst when a person is missing for that period of time.\" A DNA test confirmed Latulip's identity and police say a reunion with his mother, who moved to Ottawa years ago, is being arranged. In a 2014 interview, she told the Mercury she was still haunted by the disappearance. \"This is always at the back of my mind. Having an answer would mean closure,\" she said. (A California hospital recently identified the man it had called \"Garage 66\" for 16 years.)\n\nThose hoping to avoid the world's biggest sharks would do well to stay away from Portugal's Azore Islands. That's where whale sharks\u2014the biggest fish in the sea\u2014are making a new home, likely due to climate change, a study finds. The creatures have a very specific set of temperatures they can tolerate, ranging from 78.8 degrees to 86 degrees Fahrenheit, Discovery notes. The Azores are currently fulfilling the needs of the animals, which, LiveScience notes, can be up to 41.5 feet long and weigh a whopping 47,000 pounds. The temperatures around the Azores, off western Europe, appear to be linked to higher amounts of a favorite whale shark food: chlorophyll-a. Researchers in the area came to their shark population conclusions by assessing 16 years of data from tuna fishermen who've spotted the animals. Indeed, so many sharks have headed there that the region, previously in the northernmost part of the sharks' territory, is experiencing a boom in tourists' \"whale shark watching.\" These tourists, it seems, needn't fear: Whale sharks are by no means ferocious, LiveScience points out.

The lake, located in the Gale Crater, would have been about 30 miles long and 3 miles wide. The lake's mudstones\u2014which form in calm, still water\u2014contain traces of sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and carbon, meaning it could have supported chemolithoautotrophs, a kind of microbial that obtains energy by breaking down rock minerals.

New satellite photos show that Camp 25, thought to house about 5,000 of the 200,000 people believed to be held in North Korea's gulags, has grown steadily over the past decade, reports the Washington Post. Its perimeter grew 37% between just 2009 and 2010, according to the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, which says new buildings, guard posts, and fields have been added. Experts are unsure whether the expansion of Camp 25 signals an overall growth in political prisoners in North Korea or a move to accommodate existing prisoners as other camps are downsized. \"It appears that North Korea's vast system of unlawful imprisonment may be undergoing an alteration involving the consolidation of some of its political prison camps, and the expansion of others,\" said the executive director of the committee, according to Yonhap News."}, {"generated_summaries": ["Prosecutors representing the late American painter Thomas Kinkade, who was serving a life sentence for the 1988 rape and murder of a pregnant secretary in Binghamton, N.Y., have filed a restraining order against his live-in girlfriend, Amy Pinto-Walsh, in an attempt to prevent her from disclosing information in breach of a confidentiality agreement she signed Feb. 25, 2011, according to court documents obtained Friday afternoon by Los Gatos Patch at the Santa Clara County Superior Court in San Jose, three attorneys with the Los Angeles-based law firm of Zuber & Taillieu LLP, said they are seeking the injunction to prevent the girlfriend from making statements or engaging in conduct that would reflect negatively on the artist..", "Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen have a lot of explaining to do.https://www.dropbox.com/s/pskgpwr15r48tx5/Executive%20Summary.pdf?dl=0 \u2026", "The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings..

Whatever Pinto has on him \"would be personally devastating not only for Mrs. Kinkade, but also for the family's four daughters, who are grieving the sudden loss of their father,\" wrote Nanette's attorneys, according to the Los Gatos Patch.

According to financial records reviewed by the New York Times and NBC News, a company linked to a Russian oligarch targeted by US sanctions deposited around $500,000 into an account controlled by Essential Consultants, the shell company Cohen used to pay hush money to Daniels before the 2016 election. Michael Avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch Viktor Vekselberg may have \"replenished the account\" in a series of payments in 2017 after the Daniels settlement, though Columbus Nova, a US affiliate of a Vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to Trump's personal lawyer, the Washington Post reports. The purpose of the company's payments is unclear. Sources tell CNN that Robert Mueller's investigators have already quizzed Vekselberg about the payments to Cohen's company. Records reviewed by the Times show that around $4.4 million flowed through the Essential Consultants account between its creation weeks before the 2016 election and January this year, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical firm Novartis, AT&T, and Korea Aerospace. AT&T confirmed the payments late Tuesday, saying Cohen's firm was among those it \"engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\" the AP reports. Cohen isn't a registered lobbyist, and while the unusual payments may not have broken any laws, Trump and his attorney \"have a lot of explaining to do,\" Avenatti said in a tweet Tuesday.\n\nAfter expanding the search to Vermont, authorities hunting escaped prisoners Richard Matt and David Sweat have descended on a village just a few miles from the prison. Police have closed a stretch of State Route 374 and ordered residents of Cadyville, NY, to stay inside and keep their exterior lights on, residents tell WPTZ. In other developments: Timothy Vail was the last man to escape from a New York prison, according to the New York Daily News, and he says he hopes Matt and Sweat can avoid capture. He tells the Daily News that he hopes they \"stay out of sight and don't commit any new crimes.\" Vail, who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1988, injured himself while escaping from the Elmira Correctional Facility in 2003 and was recaptured within two days after he and a fellow fugitive stole a van. Police officers who've dealt with Matt say he is the most evil criminal they've encountered, and he was trouble from a very early age, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reports. The former chief of police in North Tonawanda, near where Matt grew up, says he's around the same age as the 48-year-old and that long before Matt's first arrest, he had a \"fearsome\" reputation and was known for terrorizing other kids on the school bus. An officer in Tonawanda tells the paper that in 1986\u201411 years before his arrest for a gruesome local murder\u2014Matt broke out of a correctional facility and was recaptured a few days later. Early reports described the pair as among the first to escape in the Clinton Correctional Facility's long history, but dozens of men have made it out in various ways since the forbidding Dannemora, NY, institution opened in 1845, the New York Times reports. In 1860, a fraudster known as the \"Gay Deceiver\" put on civilian clothes, strolled out the gate, and wasn't recaptured for a year. A history professor tells the Times that the first escapes happened just weeks after the prison opened. The reform-minded warden decided not to punish the two men after they were recaptured, the professor says, but it wasn't long before a new warden installed a dungeon for solitary confinement, where punishments included waterboarding."}]
