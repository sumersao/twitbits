An emboldened Ukraine today said that it would not reopen ceasefire negotiations until the rebels had laid down their weapons entirely, the AP reports. The once undermanned and outgunned Ukrainian force is now noticeably better armed, using buses and pickup trucks alongside its armored vehicles to transport what the Telegraph describes as a \"motley mix\" of police, special forces, and militiamen. Ukraine says it has succeeded in sealing the Russian border, preventing troops and weapons from flowing to the rebels. But Vladimir Putin has been suspiciously silent, ignoring the separatists' increasingly urgent pleas for help, and many are speculating that he aims to cut his losses, having already taken the real prize of Crimea, the Wall Street Journal reports. Observers believe Moscow has ruled out any military intervention, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov struck a decidedly peaceful tone at a news conference, saying, \"A quick end to the bloodshed is in our common interest.\" But one US official cautioned against declaring victory. \"There is only one person who knows what Putin is planning,\" he said, \"and that is Putin.\"\n\nWeird news from the land of Charlie Sheen: The troubled actor has managed to irk a group of 9/11 truthers, which is now threatening to protest in front of his live shows.

Sheen was once very vocal about his belief in the truther movement (he said the World Trade Center collapse looked like a \"controlled demolition\"), but instead of \"asking hard questions about what happened on 9/11 and the resulting wars,\" a member tells TMZ, Sheen has been \"bragging about smoking crack and sleeping with hookers.\" In other Sheen-related news from TMZ, ex Brooke Mueller is back in rehab after a weeklong binge, having refused a drug test and engaged in some other strange behavior\u2014click here for more.\n\nSienna Miller is set to join the growing list of outraged public figures taking legal action over phone-hacking by reporters at Britain's News of the World. Lawyers for the star say she plans to add her name to those seeking a review of how the police handled the case and sources at the Rupert-Murdoch owned paper say she's taking steps toward suing it because reporters allegedly listened to her voicemails, the Guardian reports. (For background and opinion on the scandal, click here.) Miller's friends say she changed her number after noticing signs that somebody else was listening to her voicemail, but jailed reporter Glen Mulcaire appears to have obtained her new number as well, although police didn't notify her when they found her PIN code in his possession.

The couple had taken their 6-month-old son to Creek Park in La Mirada, Calif. Ghonim said he felt uncomfortable after a group of people called out at his wife and he wanted to leave, reports the Los Angeles Times. But as they made to drive off, a gunman approached the passenger door, demanded money, and murdered his wife. Now, 24 years later, a jury has decided who was responsible for Vicki Ghonim's death: then-19-year-old Morrad Ghonim. The 43-year-old, who was extradited from Antigua last year, was on Monday found guilty of first-degree murder. The man who pulled the trigger, however, was Leon Martinez. Police got to Martinez by way of grant money earmarked for cold cases, reports the Whittier Daily News. A DNA test of pants found near the scene led them in 2010 to Martinez, who said Ghonim hired him and even reached over his wife's body to hand him payment. A friend of Martinez's relayed meeting a man days before Vicki's death who said he and his child's mother\u2014a student at John Glenn High, as Vicki was\u2014were having issues and planned to separate. In late January, the Daily News painted a picture of a confident defense, given that in exchange for testifying, Martinez will not serve life without parole for the murder, but instead 28 years to life. \"This is a 20-year-old murder that comes down to the credibility of a convicted killer and an ex-wife who hates Mr. Ghonim ... and promised to send him to hell,\" said one of Ghonim's lawyers, noting that Ghonim's second wife talked to police. Ghonim could be handed life without parole at his Dec. 19 sentencing.\n\nThe man who co-founded Pixar and is seen as the creative force behind blockbusters such as the Toy Story and Cars franchises will soon be out of a job at Disney. John Lasseter, 61, has been on leave from parent company Disney since November after allegations of improper workplace behavior surfaced, including his propensity to wrap up everyone he meets in long bear hugs. Disney announced Friday that Lasseter\u2014who previously acknowledged and apologized for his \"missteps\"\u2014will shift into a vague consulting role through the end of the year and then depart for good, reports the New York Times. Disney execs were wrestling for months with whether to allow Lasseter to return, but Deadline reports on a \"gathering sense\" among employees that he would not have been welcome. Disney chief Bob Iger issued a statement that praised Lasseter for \"reinventing the animation business, taking breathtaking risks, and telling original, high quality stories that will last forever,\u201d and Lasseter issued one of his own thanking Disney and saying he's \"extremely proud\" of his work but that it's time to move on. Despite the positive public comments, the move amounts to what the Los Angeles Times describes as \"a dramatic unraveling of one of the most storied careers in animation.\" The story notes that hugs were just a part of the problem, with female employees at Pixar alleging that Lasseter and other senior execs turned a blind eye to a corporate culture rife with crude jokes and inappropriate touching. (Actress and screenwriter Rashida Jones left Toy Story 4 and complained about Pixar's unequal treatment of women.)\n\nAfter Angela Lansbury said this week that women need to \"sometimes take the blame\" for sexual misconduct because they make themselves attractive to men, the backlash was fast and forceful. \"It is a deeply unhelpful myth that rape and other forms of sexual violence are caused or 'provoked' by women's sexuality or 'attractiveness,'\" ABC News quotes Rape Crisis England & Wales as saying. Actress Patricia Arquette added: \"It doesn't matter how young or old, how beautiful or homely. Rapists rape. End of story.\" Lansbury has now responded to her critics. \"There is no excuse whatsoever for men to harass women in an abusive sexual manner,\" Entertainment Weekly quotes the 92-year-old Murder She Wrote star as saying. \"And, I am devastated that anyone should deem me capable of thinking otherwise.\" Lansbury says she's \"a strong supporter of women's rights\" and is \"troubled by how quickly and brutishly some have taken my comments out of context and attempted to blame my generation, my age, or my mindset, without having read the entirety of what I said.\" To which the AV Club quips: \"Welcome to the internet, Dame Angela.\"", "- It may not surprise you to learn that Gwyneth Paltrow has sought to treat her ailments\u2014in this case inflammation and scarring\u2014by subjecting herself to the stings of live bees. \"It's a thousands-of-year-old treatment,\" the Goop mastermind told the New York Times in 2016. \"It's actually pretty incredible if you research it. But, man, it's painful.\" Now a report published in the Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology reveals what's believed to be the first death related to bee-sting therapy\u2014aka live bee acupuncture, aka bee venom apitherapy\u2014in someone who had previously shown tolerance for the treatment. In the case from 2015, a 55-year-old Spanish woman died of multiple organ failure after two years of the treatment to relieve muscular contracture and stress. In bee-sting therapy, bees placed on a patient's body have their heads squeezed until they extend their stingers, the Telegraph reports. The idea is that the stings cause inflammation and lead to an anti-inflammatory response from the body. The unnamed woman started wheezing and having shortness of breath during one of her monthly treatments at a private clinic before losing consciousness. She died weeks later at the hospital. Researchers say severe anaphylactic shock caused a \"massive watershed stroke and permanent coma,\" as well as the multiple organ failure. \"The risks of undergoing apitherapy may exceed the presumed benefits, leading us to conclude that this practice is both unsafe and unadvisable,\" one researcher says.

Caylee Anthony was last seen June 16, but was not reported missing for a full month. Crowder, who started a Change.org petition as well as a Facebook page asking Congress to create the law, says she was \"sickened\" when Casey Anthony was convicted only of lying to the police, and was not \"charged with child neglect or endangerment, or even obstruction of justice.\u201d Her Change.org petition is the fastest-growing campaign in the site's history, with nearly 2,000 people signing it each hour, the Washington Post reports.

One of the United Nations' chief investigators says evidence is building that sarin gas was used in the Syrian conflict\u2014but by rebels, not Bashar al-Assad's regime. \"Our investigators have been in neighboring countries interviewing victims, doctors, and field hospitals\" and \"there are strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof of the use of sarin gas,\" said Carla Del Ponte, a member of a panel probing alleged Syrian war crimes, Reuters reports. \"This was use on the part of the opposition, the rebels, not by the government authorities,\" she adds. The war crimes inquiry commission Del Ponte is involved with is separate from the main UN probe into chemical weapons use in Syria. Each side accused the other of using chemical weapons during fighting in Aleppo in March, while Britain and France say they have evidence that regime forces used nerve agents in attacks on rebels. In other developments: Israeli airstrikes on targets inside Syria in recent days have killed at least 42 government soldiers, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights tells the AP. Israel today emphasized that the strikes were not meant to aid rebels, Reuters adds, but rather to block weapons from Hezbollah. The Israeli move renewed debate on whether the US should use airstrikes against the Assad regime, the New York Times reports. John McCain, who yesterday blasted President Obama's \"red line\" as being \"written in disappearing ink,\" said the strikes show that Syria's air defense system may not be much of an obstacle. Opposition activists say rebel forces shot down a military helicopter last night, killing eight government troops, the AP reports. The regime's air power has long been a chief target of rebels and activists say rebels also attacked and occupied parts of an air base in the north of the country yesterday, killing the base's commander and capturing a tank unit.", "- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says officials from Saudi Arabia, the United States, Germany, France, and Britain have listened to audio recordings related to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, the AP reports. Erdogan's comments on Saturday were the first public confirmation of the existence of recordings of the Oct. 2 killing of the Washington Post columnist at the consulate where he'd gone to get papers to marry his fiancee. \"We gave the tapes,\" Erdogan said Saturday before departing for Paris, where he'll attend events with other world leaders marking the armistice that ended World War I, per Al Jazeera. \"They have listened to all the conversations in them. They know.\" NBC News notes that a State Department rep had previously denied that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had heard any such audio or seen any audio transcript when he visited Turkey last month. President Trump, meanwhile, has said that the US has asked for any audio \"if it exists.\" Erdogan called on Saudi Arabia to rid itself of the \"stain\" by cooperating with Turkey over the investigation. Erdogan said a 15-member team that Turkey says was sent to kill Khashoggi know who's behind the killing, as well as the location of his remains.

A customer tells the tabloid the pair seemed \"relaxed\" together and were \"deep in conversation\" for more than an hour. \"As they left she got on to the back of Ewan\u2019s motorbike and they sped off together,\" the customer says. The US actress split from her husband of seven years, Riley Stearns, in May, per The Sun. That was the same month a family source tells People the Star Wars star split from French wife Eve Mavrakis, 51, a production designer. The pair met on the set of the British TV series Kavanagh QC and have four daughters, Clara, 21, Jamyan, 16, Esther, 15, and Anouk, 6.

Martin Bailey says Van Gogh didn't take a razor to his ear because of an argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, though the two did quarrel that day in 1888, the Guardian reports. Instead, Van Gogh cut his ear off because he had learned that his brother, Theo, was going to get married, Bailey says. He says the struggling artist feared that the marriage would end his close relationship with his brother\u2014and that it would cause Theo to cut off the financial support Van Gogh relied on. Bailey says that Van Gogh didn't learn of the engagement while he was recovering in hospital, as previously thought, but in a letter that was delivered to him in Provence just hours before the self-mutilation. \"Had Van Gogh been elated by the engagement, it is virtually inconceivable that he would have sliced off part of his ear a few hours after receiving Theo\u2019s news, whatever other difficulties he was facing,\" Bailey writes in new book Studio of the South, per the Telegraph. Bailey, writing in the Art Newspaper, says his research into Van Gogh's years in Provence has also yielded clues to the whereabouts of Van Gogh's famous bed.

The parents of 21-year-old Savannah Gold say their suspicions were immediately aroused by the \"really strange\" message they received after she left for work at the Bonefish Grill in Jacksonville last Wednesday, People reports. \"Hey i just wanted to tell you and mom i met a really great guy and we\u2019re running away together,\" one message to her father said. \"I love him and we're leaving tonight i'll call you later when we get to where we are going.\" \"He showed it to me and I immediately knew that it was someone else,\" mother Sharon Gold tells Action News Jax. \"We text each other all day ... and this was not from my daughter.\" Says father Daniel Gold, \"The spelling was all whacked out.\" After Gold's car was found in the restaurant's parking lot with a slashed tire and her purse still inside, authorities identified manager Lee Rodarte, 28, as a suspect because of inconsistencies in his story. Police say Rodarte, who was in an on-again, off-again relationship with Gold, eventually admitted killing her and led them to her body, which he had dumped in a lake. Investigators believe Rodarte was the one who sent the text to Gold's parents. Her parents say after the disappearance, he told them he was worried about her and even helped hand out missing-person flyers. He has been charged with murder and evidence tampering and is being held without bond.\n\nTwitter's 140-character limit is all but sancrosanct, as Slate's Farhad Manjoo discovered a while back when he suggested doubling it. Diehards were horrified, and company honchos ridiculed the notion. But what's this?

(Manjoo's piece at Slate shows an example of what one of these looks like.) Add up all those extras, and \"expanded tweets\" come in at up to 410 characters, even if the original technically remains 140 or less. Blasphemy? Nope, these \"are a great development for Twitter, a way to add depth to the service while still clinging to its hyperabridged roots,\" writes Manjoo.

The actor \"bought him drink after drink after drink and when my son was drunk, Spacey made his move and sexually assaulted him,\" said Heather Unruh at a press conference Wednesday. She says Spacey stuck his hand down her son's pants and onto his genitals, and tried to convince him to go to a party where they could continue to drink, USA Today reports. A bystander asked the teen if he was OK and the teen said no, at which point the woman urged the teen to flee and he took her advice, Unruh said. Unruh, who appeared with an attorney, says her son filed a police report last week and handed over evidence; she says a criminal investigation has been opened but the Nantucket Police Department has not confirmed that. The attorney with Unruh noted that her son's accusations are \"well within\" both the civil and criminal statutes of limitations. USA Today has a list of the 14 people so far accusing Spacey of sexual assault or harassment. Meanwhile Jon Bernthal, who worked with Spacey on Baby Driver, told a SiriusXM radio show Tuesday that he lost respect for Spacey while working on the film. \"I thought he was a bit of a bully,\" Bernthal said, per People. \"I didn\u2019t really care for the way he was behaving toward some of the other people on set.\"\n\nWillie and Carol Fowler were prepared to lose their deposits. Their daughter canceled her Georgia wedding with just 40 days' notice, and the venue, food, and entertainment were already paid for. Then Willie had \"a vision,\" his wife tells ABC News. \"I was in the process of canceling out the venue and he said, 'No, what we'll do is donate it to Hosea Feed the Hungry.'\" Their daughter had volunteered for the organization, which helps homeless people in the Atlanta area, when she was younger. And that's how, on Sept. 15, the Fowler Family Celebration of Love was born. Two hundred guests were bused to Villa Christina for a four-course meal complete with coconut shrimp and salmon (the 50 kids in attendance got chicken fingers). The family hopes to get sponsors and make it an annual event, Carol tells WBUR. A rep for Hosea Feed the Hungry said the nonprofit initially thought the Fowlers were pulling their leg: \"It's a very creme de la creme wedding venue, so to say that you're going to host 200 homeless individuals at Villa Christina\u2014it sounds like a prank call.\" The Fowlers' daughter attended the event, and her dad says it was a \"bittersweet but rewarding\" experience; her mom tells Today Tamara found it \"surreal but incredibly rewarding.\" Carol has this advice: \"If you have canceled an event, do not walk away. Pick up the phone and call your favorite charity and offer it to them. We're regular, working people and anybody can do this. This is not star stuff.\" (In Boston, a homeless man who did a very good deed is being handsomely rewarded.)\n\nAs she traveled through Brazil's northern region on a mission to kayak the 4,000-mile length of the Amazon River, Emma Kelty repeated a warning from a Peruvian guide in tongue-and-cheek fashion. \"I will have my boat stolen and I will be killed too,\" she tweeted. \"Nice.\" It appears the latter part of that warning has come true. On Sept. 13\u2014a day after remarking that she'd come across dozens of men in motor boats armed with arrows and rifles near Coari, an area known to be frequented by river pirates and drug traffickers\u2014Kelty sent out a distress signal and then went silent, reports the Guardian. Authorities now believe the 43-year-old British woman had pitched her tent on the banks of an Amazon tributary near Lauro Sodr\u00e9 when she was approached by men who shot her and threw her body in the river. A man and two 17-year-olds are in custody while police search for four other suspects who may have tried to sell Kelty's tech devices. A search for Kelty's body is also underway. A statement from Kelty's siblings note they're \"extremely proud\" of their sister, who sought \"to prove that challenges were achievable.\" (She had quit her job as a school principal in 2014 to travel solo.) Back in February, Kelty\u2014who became the sixth woman to ski solo to the South Pole in January\u2014told the BBC that surviving encounters with \"people who organ-harvest and rob and fire guns\" was \"half the challenge\" of her Amazon adventure. \"But it's about minimizing the risk,\" she said. \"I'm going to a self-defense course which is going to be tailored to de-arming people, so if I do come across that situation at least I'm prepared for it.\"", "- OJ Simpson has been out of prison for more than a month, and he's not exactly being a model parolee, according to TMZ. Sources tell the website that Simpson was chucked out of the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas for being drunk and belligerent. According to TMZ's sources, Simpson \" was angry at hotel staff and glasses broke at the bar,\" though he behaved himself when security arrived to escort him out. Simpson is now apparently permanently banned from the hotel, though his lawyer, Malcolm LaVergne, says it was nothing to do with his client's behavior. He claims the hotel decided to ban Simpson even before he arrived. \"Cosmopolitan exercised its right to issue a trespass notice,\" LaVergne said in a statement. \"Any private property in Nevada has the right to tell any person that you are trespassing and please don\u2019t come back; if you come back you are subject to a misdemeanor arrest.\" If Simpson was drunk, he could be in violation of parole terms, the Washington Post reports, though a witness tells KABC that Simpson abstained while other members of his party drank wine. LaVergne says Simpson was neither drunk nor belligerent and only tends to have one drink when he is socializing, WXYZ reports. (Since his release from prison, Simpson has been signing autographs and living in a friend's Las Vegas mansion.)\n\nThe second episode of Sacha Baron Cohen's Who Is America? aired Sunday night on Showtime, and it may have claimed its first casualty: Georgia lawmakers are calling for state Rep. Jason Spencer to step down after what Mic calls a \"life-ruining appearance\" on the show. \"Of all the individuals featured in Who Is America? so far, Spencer seems the most likely to have damaged his career,\" Kathryn VanArendonk and Megh Wright declare on Vulture. The segment featured Baron Cohen, pretending to be an Israeli \"anti-terrorism expert\" named Erran Morad, supposedly teaching Spencer (who introduced a bill in 2016 that would have effectively barred Muslims from wearing burkas or niqabs) how to protect himself from Islamic extremists. Read on for what happened, the reaction that has followed, and more from the episode: So what exactly did Spencer do during the segment? He pretended to be a Chinese tourist (attempting to imitate a Chinese accent and spouting what Mic calls \"racist gibberish\"), pulled down his pants and underwear to thrust his bare buttocks at Morad after Morad told him members of ISIS believe any man who comes in contact with another man's butt will become homosexual, and repeatedly shouted the n-word as part of a kidnapping role-playing exercise in which Morad told him that doing so would attract attention to himself.

And we didn't think it was a gunshot, we thought it was a firecracker. And then we heard another one,\" she said. \"And so, one of the students in my class, she went out and checked it. She got shot twice, one in the arm, and in the stomach. And she came back and told us to lock the door, shut the lights off. And we sat there for 20 minutes waiting for police to show up. It felt like forever.\" Gordon said she's not sure how the student who was shot is doing now, Reuters reports. Student Kortney Moore says a bullet came through the window of her writing class in Snyder Hall; she saw her teacher shot in the head. The shooter came inside the room and told people to get on the ground, she tells the local News-Review. She says he then asked people to stand up and say their religion before he started firing.

The show, which reached 40 million viewers every Saturday night, featured glamorous host Ding Yu speaking to condemned criminals days, hours, or even just minutes before their execution. Officials at China's Legal TV say the show, which just started popping up in Western press for the first time in advance of a BBC documentary on the show that aired last night, has been axed because of \"internal problems,\" ABC reports. Some 55 crimes carry the death penalty in China, but Interviews focused only on murderers. In an interview with the BBC, Ding denied that the program was exploitative. \"Some viewers may consider it cruel to ask a criminal to do an interview when they are about to be executed. On the contrary, they want to be heard,\" she said. \"Some criminals I interviewed told me: 'I'm really very glad. I said so many things in my heart to you at this time. In prison, there was never a person I was willing to talk to about past events.'\"\n\nA police officer and national guardsman from Colorado is missing on Russia's tallest mountain, the Denver Post reports. Steven Beare, attempting his first solo climb without a guide, was due at a checkpoint June 16 but never arrived. \"We know that there was a really bad storm that came in really quick out of nowhere,\" his wife Olivia Beare tells ABC 7. \"We're thinking that's when he got lost.\" According to Russian media, an eight-person rescue team tried to follow Beare's route on Mount Elbrus but gave up the search Sunday. Olivia Beare is currently paying a private rescue team $2,500 an hour to continue looking for her husband. The Colorado Police Officers Foundation is collecting donations. Beare, an Army veteran with a young child and another on the way, has been climbing for five years, KDVR reports. His goal was to summit the world's seven highest peaks; he had already climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. Olivia Beare, who hasn't spoken to her husband since he arrived in Russia on June 12, says he has the skills to survive a blizzard but may be injured. \"I'm really scared,\" she tells ABC 7. She adds to KDVR: \"I can\u2019t raise two babies by myself.\" Littleton Police Chief Doug Stephens says cops \"fight through and win\" when things seem hopeless, and he's sure Beare is doing just that.\n\nA 15-year-old Kansas City girl has been charged with two counts of second-degree murder after allegedly killing her parents, prosecutors announced Monday\u2014and police allege they found some damning content on her phone. WDAF reports Daejona Holmes placed a 911 call on April 9 saying her parents\u2014Kinderly Holmes, 37, and Brian Starr, 38\u2014had been killed in a robbery. But during two interviews with investigators, the story shifted: Per court documents, Holmes first said she was at home heating up pasta as her parents argued, heard a shot, walked past her father and saw her mother's body, then grabbed a gun and killed her father downstairs. During the next interview, she allegedly added details: She said she entered the home a second time to get her mom's phone, changed her clothes, and moved her dad's body. After securing a search warrant for Holmes' phone, investigators say they discovered a web search for \"scary movies where kids kill parents,\" rap lyrics expressing a desire to see her dad dead, and a Feb. 15 video of a dancing, gun-toting Holmes in her bedroom. They also allegedly uncovered a stick-figure drawing in a backpack featuring \"me\" and \"dad\"; \"me\" held a gun. The Kansas City Star reports Kinderly Holmes' body was found with a fatal gunshot wound to the stomach in an upstairs bedroom; Starr was near the front door and had been shot in the mouth and torso. KMBC reports Holmes will be tried as an adult, which is why her name has been released."]}, {"generated_summaries": ["A video released by Mexican media outlets Wednesday appears to show a soldier executing a civilian lying face down in the street with a shot to the back of his head.The video's circulation was quickly followed by condemnation and pledges from the defense department to determine its authenticity and the Attorney General's Office to investigate the May 3 events in the town of Palmarito.But late Wednesday, the gritty intersection showed no signs of any investigation.Bullet-pocked facades and windows and the reluctance of residents to talk were the only indications anything occurred.The security camera footage first published by Diario Cambio purportedly depicts part of the military's encounter with fuel pipeline thieves that the government said left 10 dead in the central state of Puebla.Fuel theft has long plagued Mexico, but is generating more violence lately as federal authorities crack down.In a 630-page deposition recorded over two days in late May, Greer, who is on trial for corruption charges, unloaded a litany of charges against the \"whack-a-do, right-wing crazies'' in his party, including the effort to suppress the black vote.He also said party officials discussed how \"minority outreach programs were not fit for the Republican Party.\"The Associated Press could not independently verify the video's authenticity..", "An elderly Treasure Coast man is behind bars accused of murdering his ill, 78-year-old wife because she was in poor health and they could no longer afford the medications necessary for her care, according to an arrest affidavit from the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office.William J.

The heavily edited video, taken from a surveillance camera, shows a car coming under fire during what the military describes as a series of ambushes that left four soldiers and six suspects dead in Palmarito on May 3. As soldiers surround the vehicle, its occupants exit and are forced to lie down in front of the car. Soldiers are then seen dragging a suspect to the same spot. He appears injured but rolls from his back onto his front. Six minutes later, a soldier appears at the side of the frame and appears to shoot the man in the back of the head, per the AP. A dark stain spreads around him, reports Reuters. \"There was already concern about the use of excessive force by the military.

Now former Florida GOP chairman Jim Greer is saying on record that, yes, those laws are actually about stopping black people from voting, reports Salon, picking up on a story in the Tampa Bay Times. \u201cI was upset because the political consultants and staff were talking about voter suppression and keeping blacks from voting,\u201d Greer said, recalling a 2009 meeting with party officials. Greer also said the party's budget committee had been taken over by \"whack-a-do, right-wing crazies.\" Greer is hardly without an axe to grind, though. His statements came from a 630-page deposition made in May as part of his trial on corruption charges. Greer paid a company he owned nearly $200,000 from GOP coffers while he was the chairman, although he contends it was authorized and made for services rendered. Florida state Sen. John Thrasher, who succeeded Greer as party chairman, called Greer's comments about voter suppression \"baseless accusations on other people in an effort to divert attention from himself.''\n\nOn Feb. 26, the day Tim Tebow arrived for the New York Mets' Minor League Baseball camp at First Data Field in Port St. Lucie, Fla., a woman arrived at the stadium early in the morning, hung around all day, and asked lots of questions about Tebow. That prompted staff members to report her to police, but 36-year-old Michelle Marie Thompson had an explanation when they arrived to question her: She told them she's in a relationship with Tebow, TCPalm reports. Making her story even more believable: Police reported that they found a sticker on her driver's license reading, \"I [heart symbol] Jesus/Tim Tebow.\" But, when police asked the Colorado woman to specify what type of relationship she meant, she said it wouldn't be appropriate to say; when asked if it was a friendly, platonic, romantic, or matrimonial relationship, she claimed \"all of the above\" while giggling. She went so far as to claim that her current address was the same as Tebow's in Jacksonville, because they live together, and she gave police a Jacksonville address, Action News Jax reports. Police told her to leave the stadium and not return, but two days later she allegedly did; she was arrested that time and charged with trespassing.", "- William Hager watched his 78-year-old wife, Carolyn, suffer from medical problems, including arthritis, for 15 years. But when the couple could no longer afford her medication, an ominous idea popped into his head, per CNN. Authorities say Hager, 86, called police around 1pm Monday, allegedly telling responding deputies, \"I have bad news. I shot my wife at 7:30 this morning. I want to apologize I didn't call earlier. I wanted to tell my kids what happened first,\" reports WPBF. He said he shot his wife in the head as she slept because she previously said she wanted to die, was in pain, and couldn't afford medication, per an affidavit. \"He felt that he was at a point that this was his only course of action,\" says the chief deputy in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Hager was booked in St. Lucie County Jail and charged with first-degree premeditated murder. A neighbor tells WPTV that Carolyn Hager had complained about \"excruciating\" back pain a few days earlier, but \"they seemed like such a nice couple \u2026 so it was quite a shock.\" Another neighbor says she faced a similar situation when her husband couldn't afford his medication and asked her to shoot him, but she couldn't. \"He suffered so badly and there's nothing you can do,\" she says, noting prescription medications should be more affordable. The Hagers filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and William took a job at Sears to help pay for Carolyn's medications; it isn't clear if he knew a local clinic helps people pay for medications not covered by insurance.\n\nLady Gaga was Billboard\u2019s top new artist last year, and this year she\u2019s moved on to snag the top artist-of-the-year honors.

(The move comes a day after President Obama promised that a US team would help the cause.) But Boko Haram, the group that kidnapped the girls and vows to sell them, remains as defiant and brutal as ever. A new attack in the town of Gamboru Ngala, near the border with Cameroon, massacred at least 150 villagers, reports CNN.

After being tagged with a transmitter by research organization Ocearch back in 2012 off the coast of Cape Cod, Mary Lee gained a legion of loyal followers tracking her ocean journeys. (She has nearly 130,000 Twitter followers.) However, no ping has been registered since June, reports the Post and Courier of Charleston, SC. The good news is that this doesn't necessarily mean the end of Mary Lee: Chris Fischer of Ocearch tells Jacksonville.com that it's more likely the batteries in her transmitter, designed to last about five years, have finally given out. Fischer hopes to see Mary Lee again, but is OK if that never happens. \u201cI feel like she\u2019s done so much, it\u2019s hard to ask for anything else,\u201d he says. \u201cFor any individual shark, she\u2019s undone more of the damage from Jaws than any shark in history, and she\u2019s the most famous shark in history.\u201d Mary Lee was 40 or 50 years old when first tagged, so Fischer figures she has another 20 years of life.

That's only the first eyebrow-raiser about the country's electoral process, held every four years so voters can \"choose\" mayors, governors, and local assemblies. North Koreans over age 17 are not only required to show, they're also told which preapproved candidates to vote for by placing already prepared ballots in the ballot boxes, CNN notes. And according to Sky, it was a \"festive atmosphere,\" with voters \"singing and dancing\" as they cast votes. \"All participants took part in the elections with extraordinary enthusiasm to cement the revolutionary power,\" the Korean Central News Agency proclaimed. Voting is simple: To vote \"yes\" for the candidate predetermined by Kim Jong Un's Workers' Party, participants just place their ballot in the correct box; those who vote \"no\" place their ballot in a separate box, all within view of elections officials, the Economist explained in 2014. Abstaining or voting no is viewed as treason, the BBC notes. The real reason for even having the vote is basically to serve as a census of sorts and to keep track of no-show defectors, NK News notes. A professor of Asian studies explains that this election system makes even more extreme the one used in the Soviet Union during the Cold War, including the ridiculously high turnout rates. \"People used to joke that on the day of elections that no one would dare to die in North Korea, let alone lose consciousness,\" he says. As for that 0.3% who didn't vote this time? KCNA says those individuals either live abroad or work \"on the high seas,\" per Chosun Ilbo.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren went after Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf during a Senate hearing Tuesday with the kind of heat she usually reserves for Donald Trump tweetstorms. \"You should resign ... and you should be criminally investigated,\" NPR quotes Warren as saying. Stumpf was in front of the Senate banking committee after Wells Fargo employees created millions of fake accounts for customers without their permission in order to charge them extra fees. Stumpf said he was \"deeply sorry\" for what happened, New Republic reports. But\u2014according to CNBC\u2014he maintained it wasn't a \"scam\"\u2014Warren's word\u2014but a \"way of deepening relationships\" with customers. Warren accused Stumpf of \"gutless leadership\" for passing responsibility for what happened away from himself and other senior executives while blaming \"thousands of $12-an-hour employees who were just trying to meet cross-sell quotas that made you rich.\" The employees' cross-selling scheme was at least partially responsible for Wells Fargo stock going up, making Stumpf's shares alone gain $200 million in value. While more than 5,000 Wells Fargo employees were fired, none of the senior executives are losing their jobs. Warren said the only way Wall Street will be reformed is if CEOs like Stumpf start seeing jail time. She's one of only a few members of the Senate banking committee that hasn't gotten money from Wells Fargo's PAC.", "- Police have released surveillance video of Kenneka Jenkins, the Chicago teen whose death in a walk-in hotel freezer after a party last weekend has led to protests and theories that she was murdered. The footage, which appears to be from a motion-activated camera at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Rosemont, Ill, doesn't capture the moment the 19-year-old entered the freezer, but it shows her walking, alone and apparently disoriented, through a disused hotel kitchen on the way there, reports the Chicago Tribune. The video shows that nobody else entered the kitchen area until her frozen body was found early Sunday morning, almost 24 hours after friends said she was missing. Video from early in the evening shows Jenkins with friends, but a later clip shows her emerge from an elevator alone and so unsteady that she had to hold on to a wall, the New York Daily News reports. Another shows her wandering down a hotel hallway. Police say they have interviewed 25 party guests and they have no reason to believe Jenkins was murdered, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Sam Adam Jr., an attorney for the Jenkins family, says lawyers will carry out their own investigation. The hotel \"never searched, they never did anything while a young, 19-year-old disoriented girl was sitting in their freezer,\" he told reporters Friday. \"Now there has to be an answer to how that happened. Better yet, there has to be an answer to why that happened.\"\n\nIn 2011, the Social Security Administration put the kibosh on mailing paper statements to 150 million future retirees, at an annual cost savings of $72 million. But last month's budget contained language that forces the government to plan for restarting these paper mailings. Ridiculous? Not according to a group called Consumers for Paper Options, which lobbied for that change and has since 2010 been \"advocating for access to paper-based services and information,\" as the group puts it. But though the group says it's a \"coalition of individuals and organizations,\" it's actually a product of the paper industry, the Washington Post reports: It was established by the Envelope Manufacturers Association and gets funding from the top paper-industry trade group. The Treasury expects to save $1 billion over a decade following its 2013 move to largely paperless communications, noting that processing a paper check costs $1.25, which is $1.16 cents more than the cost of an electronic payment. (It hasn't stopped paper mailings to the elderly and people with \"mental impairments,\" the Post notes.) But \"if there are Americans who can't use an iPhone to navigate the Internet, there ought to be an option for them,\" says a rep for Consumers for Paper Options, noting that a quarter of the US lacks Internet access. He also cites a study that says 73% of adults don't believe they should have to deal with the government online. That study was run by the group. A recent op-ed in Roll Call signed by a pair of congressmen also pushed for paper; it turns out Consumers for Paper Options was involved in that piece, too. Who are the \"consumers\"? \"Everybody\u2019s mother and father and sister who care about the way government policy develops,\" says an industry leader.\n\nAn attempt at \"upskirting,\" an exploding camera, and a guilty conscience led to \u2026 no arrest in Wisconsin, but the story is still attracting attention nationwide. The Wisconsin State Journal reports on the unidentified 32-year-old man at the center of it all, showing up Tuesday at a Madison police station to turn himself in for what he'd intended to do: take pictures up women's skirts by using a shoe camera. The Washington Post notes it's not exactly clear what a \"shoe camera\" is, but the man apparently was able to attach some kind of photographic device to his shoe and was testing it at home when the battery exploded, injuring his foot, Officer David Dexheimer tells the Journal. After getting treatment for the minor burns he received from the mini-blast, the man confessed his unsavory intentions to a clergyman, who encouraged him to turn himself in to police, Dexheimer says. There's a Wisconsin law on the books that outlaws anyone from purposely installing a device to photograph or otherwise record under a person's clothes without that person's consent, but the man in this case caught a lucky break: Per Madison Police Chief Mike Koval's daily \"significant calls\" blog, \"the subject was counseled on his actions and released from the scene as no illicit video had been taken.\" Koval notes there is an ongoing investigation, however.

(KTRK) -- Federal investigators working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller are keenly focused on President Donald Trump's role in crafting a response to a published article about a meeting between Russians and his son Donald Jr., three sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.The meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times, also involved Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya and former Soviet intelligence officer Rinat Akhmetshin.The FBI charged Howard, a resident of Naperville, Illinois, with one count of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities, a felony.Investigators say Howard managed to do extensive damage to the host computer, as well as the lines to radar in the facility.The Air Route Control Center monitors high altitude aircraft before landing in Chicago or flying through the area.Much of that work is being handled for the time being by other facilities in surrounding states, but at a much more limited capacity.The ripple effect caused the cancellation of flights at airports across the nation.Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport had 70 cancellations on Friday, compared to seven on Thursday, according to Flightaware, a flight-tracking website.LaGuardia Airport in New York City had 56 on Friday and 10 on Thursday.The effect of the fire on Saturday's flight activity has not been determined and it was not clear when the center would reopen.Howard had worked eight years in the center but faced a transfer to Hawaii, the FBI says in an affidavit.The documents don't specify his job title but said he worked in \"telecommunications matters.\".The complaint says paramedics from the Aurora Fire Department then responded to a 911 call placed at approximately 5:42 a.m. by an individual at the FAA center.Paramedics entered the basement and followed a trail of blood that led them to Howard, officials said.\"They covered him, attempted to get him out of the building.."], "gt_summaries": ["- Reese Witherspoon never regrets becoming an actress, but she does miss one thing: her privacy. \"I parted with my privacy a long time ago,\" she tells Vogue in a new profile. \"We went different ways.

Polls ahead of Election Day showed Conservatives locked in a tight race with the opposition Labour Party, raising the possibility of days or weeks of negotiations to form a government. Instead, the party won an outright majority, taking 326 of 650 seats. But as Prime Minister David Cameron returns to 10 Downing Street in a stronger position than before, a trio of big names are out: Labour Party leader Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, and Independence Party leader Nigel Farage have resigned in the election's wake. More: Line of the night, from Cameron: \"I want my party, and I hope a government that I would like to lead, to reclaim a mantle that we should never have lost\u2014the mantle of one nation, one United Kingdom.\" CNN runs down the implications of the Conservative Party win. Two big ones: Expect to start reading the word \"Brexit\" much more often, with Cameron having vowed to hold a 2017 referendum on whether the UK should remain a part of the EU. And could Scotland leave Britain? CNN presents the possibility, noting that the Scottish National Party's victory was a staggering one, with it taking 56 out of the 59 UK parliamentary seats in Scotland. CNN points to \"rumblings in the British press\" that such an SNP victory could spur yet another referendum, this one in 2016, on a split. The view from Michael Wolff: \"It might be argued that the Cameron government's campaign last year to defeat the referendum for Scottish independence helped propel the popularity of the SNP, which in turn undermined the Labour Party's traditional strength in Scotland, thereby helping to [ensure] the Tory victory,\" he writes in USA Today.

Today is indeed believed to be the North Korean leader's birthday, but it's unclear whether he's 31, 32, or 33. Kim's birth year, per the South Korean government, was likely 1982, 1983, or 1984. And while Yonhap reports that China sent him birthday wishes, USA Today notes there is no elaborate public celebration to mark the day, as was the case with his father's and grandfather's birthdays. \"There's a lot of speculation why that's the case,\" a South Korean professor tells CNN. \"Kim could be trying to put out this image as a humble guy,\" or he could just be trying to downplay the fact that he's young. \"When you start marking his birthday, then the whole North Korean people will start to wonder, then what's his age?\" USA Today speculates that when his age is finally revealed, 1982 will be the year named, perhaps regardless of whether that's the truth: His grandfather was born in 1912, and his father 30 years later. Forty years after that is ... 1982.

Trump didn't go into detail on potential successors, except to say the person would need \"intellect.\" And he emphasized the ramifications: \"We have to pick a great one that is going to be there for 40 years or 45 years.\" (The pick is expected to come from this list, notes Time.) As NPR reports, Trump also has begun casting the issue as an crucial one in the 2018 midterms, arguing that it's more important than ever that the GOP retain its grip on the Senate. \"Justice Kennedy's retirement makes the issue of Senate control one of the vital issues of our time\u2014the most important thing we can do,\" Trump told the crowd. He was there stumping for Rep. Kevin Cramer, the GOP challenger to Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who is seen as one of the most vulnerable incumbent Democrats given that she represents a red state. \"Heidi will vote no to any pick we make for the Supreme Court,\" he said, though NPR notes she was one of three Democrats to vote in favor of Trump's first pick, Neil Gorsuch.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has ordered emergency inspections of 80 older Boeing 737s similar to the Southwest plane that suddenly cracked open last week during a flight. The order covers aircraft built with a specific process in the '80s and '90s and those that have more than 30,000 flight cycles, ABC News reports. Some 78 of the jets in question belong to Southwest Airlines\u2014which has carried out its own inspections\u2014and two are being used by Alaska Airlines. Inspectors must use an electro-magnetic process that detects cracks invisible to the naked eye. Neither the Federal Aviation Administration nor Boeing currently requires checks to be carried out on the section of aircraft that cracked open. The incident \"could change the conversation regarding the risk of aging aircraft,\" and lead to tougher, more expensive inspections, the president of the Flight Safety Foundation tells USA Today.", "- An elderly man who's wanted kids his whole life just learned that he's had one\u2014for 61 years.

Now Trapani, who's 81 and lives in Grand Rapids, Mich., has met his 61-year-old son, Samuel Childress, who grew up in Pennsylvania assuming his father didn't want to know him, reports the New York Daily News. \"He's my full son that I've had my whole life, but why my wife hid that letter is beyond me,\" Trapani tells Fox 17. \"I don't know.

The New York Times reports those videos, shot by overheard aircraft on March 4, 2002, may show Air Force Technical Sergeant John Chapman fighting al-Qaeda militants and killing two while alone on a mountaintop in Afghanistan. What's so shocking about the footage is not just the bravery. It's that Chapman was supposed to be dead. He was originally there with members of SEAL Team 6, providing support as their radioman. In the midst of a fierce and disastrous operation, Senior Chief Petty Officer Britt Slabinski determined the men needed to get off the mountain. Slabinski couldn't verify the wounded Chapman was dead, but he was nearly certain. So a \"dead\" Chapman was left behind. The Air Force now suspects Chapman was alive for roughly another hour and tried to provide cover for a helicopter carrying Army Ranger reinforcements (three Rangers were among seven Americans to die that day; some say blame rests at the SEALs' feet). The conclusion comes thanks to technology that assigns those on the ground a pixel signature that can be tracked even when ground cover blocks a man from view. The Air Force secretary wants Chapman given the Medal of Honor; SEAL Team 6 has no issue with that, but hasn't taken a stance on whether Chapman was alive. Slabinski is outwardly skeptical, and suggests the Air Force would welcome a Medal of Honor, which it hasn't seen one of its own get since Vietnam. But a fresh look at Chapman's autopsy may provide further proof he was alive.

William Steele, 90, was spraying to kill bees that had built a hive in the fireplace of a small house he owned in a remote area of the ranch when they swarmed and attacked him, his wife, and his son, reports the Valley Morning Star. Steele tried to run from the cabin but collapsed and was stung hundreds of times. The couple's 67-year-old son was also stung but he managed to escape and get to the nearest phone to call authorities. Deputies without any protective equipment braved the swarm to rescue Myrtle Steele, 92. She had been stung some 300 times and died several days later in a nearby hospital. \"It was a terrible thing,\" an investigator with the Jim Hogg County Sheriff's office tells Reuters. \"You don't prepare for something like that. \"", "- A Florida Republican is looking to halt funding for Robert Mueller's special investigation into ties between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia and bar review of all matters before Trump's campaign kicked off. The amendment put forth by Rep. Ron DeSantis would block Mueller from investigating \"matters occurring before June 2015\" and end funding for the probe 180 days after the amendment is passed, reports the Hill. DeSantis says the order appointing the special counsel \"didn't identify a crime to be investigated and practically invites a fishing expedition\" and that \"Congress should use its spending power to clarify the scope and limit the duration of this investigation,\" per Politico. The amendment by DeSantis\u2014who some suspect will run for governor of Florida in 2018, per Florida Politics\u2014is just one of hundreds attached to the government spending bill and may never make it through committees. The House Rules Committee, Politico notes, has freedom to strike out amendments it deems improper. The bill will be reviewed after lawmakers return from a recess next week. While House members have been away, Mueller has apparently been busy.

Burma currently has contracts with several foreign firms, including Chevron, Total, and China's CNPC. \"Quite frankly, none of us know what's in those contracts,\" Suu Kyi said, according to Reuters. Suu Kyi did, however, allow that, despite having struck a deal with the junta, Total \"is a responsible investor in the country\" and was \"sensitive to human rights and environmental issues.\" She also called for a \"democracy-friendly development policy\" coupled with various business reforms. \"No country can claim genuine development until all its peoples can enjoy the basic freedoms. Freedom from want, and freedom from fear,\" she said, according to this video. The visit is part of Suu Kyi's first trip to Europe in decades.\n\nAnyone hoping to fly into or out of Chicago could be in for a delay today along with numerous others. More than 850 flights have been canceled out of Chicago's O'Hare International and Midway International airports after an employee allegedly set a fire in the basement of a major Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control center around 6am local time. The FBI is on the scene after the man was found with self-inflicted cuts to his wrist, also in the basement, WLS reports. Sources say the fire, now extinguished, was intentional and that the employee \"used accelerant to start the fire near sensitive flight equipment.\" He also may have revealed his plan online, a source says. Authorities were seen confiscating a car at the facility hours after the fire began. All employees were evacuated. Another man was treated for smoke inhalation. Apart from flights into and out of Chicago, the incident at the Aurora, Ill., center could also delay thousands of \"long-distance routes to other regions\" as the center \"controls air traffic for a giant swath of the Midwest,\" CNN reports. But the ground stop was recently lifted, and FAA officials say flights have resumed at a \"reduced rate.\" Even so, travelers are urged to check their flight status, as many flights were delayed or re-routed."]}, {"generated_summaries": ["In a world where everyone from Fido to Great Aunt Fifi wears some variation of a pedometer or Fitbit, there are few workouts left that can't be tracked electronically..

In the speech to Al Sharpton's National Action Network, Mediaite reports that Holder went off script with these lines: \u201cThe last five years have been defined by significant strides and by lasting reforms even in the face, even in the face of unprecedented, unwarranted, ugly and divisive adversity.

Back then, an annoyed Gohmert apparently misspoke, asserting that \"the attorney general will not cast aspersions on my asparagus.\u201d Gohmert wasn't Holder's only critic at yesterday's hearing. Rep. Blake Farenthold said he would ask no questions because Holder should \"be in jail.\" Gohmert, for his part, tells Fox News that he has no personal enmity toward Holder, reports Politico. \"It\u2019s a matter of proper oversight and \u2026 I don\u2019t think he\u2019s doing his job.\"", "- Mitt Romney has been doing his opponent some serious favors during his trip to London. He's managed to offend the British public with remarks about Olympic preparedness, prompting a witty comeback from David Cameron. He let slip that he'd met with the boss of MI6. And he called the leader of the opposition Labor party \"Mr. Leader,\" not the norm in the UK. It's \"almost too embarrassing\" to compare Candidate Obama's Europe trip with Romney's, writes Nicholas Watt in the Guardian. \"Obama wooed a quarter of a million people in Berlin while Romney was mocked by the British prime minister,\" Watt notes. Here's a tip for the candidate: \"Try not to offend your host, particularly when he is the leader of your closest sister party in a country that is meant to enjoy a 'special relationship' with the US.\" Another Romney gaffe, picked up by Gawker: He said he was looking \"out of the backside of 10 Downing Street,\" which sounds even worse in Britain than it does in the States.\n\nStephon Clark was killed by California police in his own backyard when officers fired 20 rounds at him, striking him multiple times, CBS Sacramento reports. According to the Sacramento Bee, police in Sacramento were responding Sunday night to reports of a man breaking car windows when they found Clark in his backyard. Police say the 22-year-old man at first fled before approaching officers while holding an \"object\" that he \"extended in front of him.\" Police say the officers thought it was a gun and, fearing for their safety, opened fire on Clark. Police initially said the object turned out to be a \"tool bar\" of some kind only to later revise that: Clark was apparently holding only a cellphone. No gun was found at the scene. \u201cI know there could have been another way. He didn\u2019t have to die,\u201d Clark's older brother tells CBS. \"He didn't deserve it.\" Clark's grandmother, who lives at the home, says neither she nor her husband heard officers give Clark any orders before opening fire. Police say Clark used an object, possibly a cinder block or piece of aluminum, to break a neighbor's glass door and the windows of at least three cars in the area before he was killed. Police say they will release body camera and helicopter footage of the shooting within a week. Salena Manni, Clark's girlfriend of five years and mother of his two young children, tells KXTV he wouldn't have threatened officers. \"He had too much to lose,\" she says. \"He would never want to leave his kids.\"\n\nNew York magazine doesn't beat around the bush: \"Unless the economy goes into a recession over the next year and a half, Hillary Clinton is probably going to win the presidential election.\" But not everyone agrees. A sampling of what the pundits are saying: In New York, Jonathan Chait argues that \"the United States has polarized into stable voting blocs, and the Democratic bloc is a bit larger and growing at a faster rate.\" That should put Clinton in the White House, though it's not guaranteed. \"She cannot promise her supporters a dramatic change or new possibilities,\" Chait notes. \"Her worry is that ennui sets in among the base and yields a small electorate more like the kind that shows up at the midterms, which is an electorate Republicans can win.\" But at Salon, a former aide for Bill Clinton is concerned about his wife's strategy so far. \"Republicans love to paint Democrats as elitists. It\u2019s how the first two Bushes took out Dukakis, Gore, and Kerry\u2014and how Jeb plans to take out Hillary,\" Bill Curry writes. And Clinton isn't helping herself. \"When she says she and Bill were broke when they left the White House; when she sets her own email rules and says it was only for her own convenience; when she hangs out with the Davos, Wall Street, or Hollywood crowds, she makes herself a more inviting target.\" Meanwhile, statistician Nate Silver acknowledges that Clinton is \"very likely to become the Democratic nominee.\" As for the general election, he writes at FiveThirtyEight, it could go either way. Silver questions the so-called \"Emerging Democratic Majority\" that plays a role in Chait's thinking. Right now, Clinton's favorability ratings are \"break-even,\" and she's \"so well-known \u2026 that it\u2019s almost as if voters are dispensing with all the formalities and evaluating her as they might when she\u2019s on the ballot next November. About half of them would like to see her become president and about half of them wouldn\u2019t. Get ready for an extremely competitive election.\" While the pundits debate, Clinton is heading out on the trail in a van named \"Scooby.\"", "- The latest Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act may very well be dead after Sen. John McCain announced his opposition to it Friday, the AP reports. \"I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal,\" CNN quotes McCain as saying in a statement. \"I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried.\" This would be the second time McCain has put a nail in the coffin of Republican efforts to end ObamaCare. McCain said he couldn't vote for the Graham-Cassidy bill without a CBO score, which wouldn't be available until later this month, to let him know \"how much it will cost, how it will affect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it.\" Republicans could only afford to have two senators side with Democrats in opposition to the bill. Sen. Rand Paul was already opposed and Sen. Susan Collins was leaning that way. A recent poll found only 24% of Americans support the Graham-Cassidy bill and 50% disapprove of it, the Hill reports.\n\nThe ex-professional wrestler known to his fans as \"The Hitman\" has just taken a hit of his own. Bret Hart has prostate cancer, he told fans in an Instagram post Monday, and he says he'll be having surgery within days, ESPN reports. \"Mark Helprin wrote: 'We are all perfect clocks that Divinity has set to ticking when, even before birth, the heart explodes into a lifelong dance.' I've had a great lifelong dance and I'm a survivor of many hard battles. I now face my toughest battle,\" the 58-year-old Canadian wrote. Hart, who suffered a stroke in 2002 and says he hopes to raise cancer awareness, notes in the Instagram post, \"I openly declare myself in my fight against prostate cancer. In the next few days, I will undergo surgery with the hope of defeating this nemesis once and for all. \u2026 I will wage my fearsome fight against cancer with one shield and one sword carrying my determination and my fury for life, emboldened by all the love that's kept me going this long already.\" (The pro wrestling world lost both Dusty Rhodes and Roddy Piper last year.)\n\nGeorge Zimmerman is making headlines again, and these ones aren't good, either. A man in Lake Mary, Fla., says Zimmerman threatened to shoot him in a road rage confrontation, then showed up two days later near the man's work site, reports the Orlando Sentinel. Though he called police, who arrived and confirmed that it was indeed Zimmerman, the other man declined to press charges and Zimmerman wasn't arrested. Officers briefly confiscated a handgun from Zimmerman, who was acquitted last year in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, but returned it to him, shook hands, and sent him on his way. The incident began Tuesday morning, when 35-year-old Matthew Apperson made a U-turn on Lake Mary Boulevard and a truck soon pulled up alongside. He recognized the driver as Zimmerman, who reportedly said, \"Do you know who I am? I will kill you,\" reports AP. When Apperson pulled off at a gas to phone police, Zimmerman followed but left before officers arrived. Two days later, Apperson called 911 again when he spotted Zimmerman in his truck, near Apperson's place of work. Zimmerman told officers he had a doctor's appointment nearby.", "- Those who complain baseball is too slow may be heartened to hear a quicker pace is on its way. Based on a Tuesday evening tweet from ESPN's Howard Bryant, Sports Illustrated reports that, starting with the 2017 season, MLB pitchers will no longer have to waste time lobbing four pitches at batters they plan to intentionally walk. Instead, teams can now simply signal the ump that a walk is in the works, and the runner can immediately saunter over to first. This change could shave 14.3 seconds off of each game, per estimates by the Wall Street Journal. The Washington Post notes \"not everyone is thrilled\" with the change, including those who enjoy watching what happens when intentional-walk pitches go wild or batters go for them anyway. Others wonder if the time savings is worth the effort, with one commenter noting: \"Is the automatic IBB really gonna fix pace of play?\" (Start reading about baseball's \"most interesting pitcher\" with all that time you just gained.)\n\nDid a brain-damaged American help turn the Boston bombing suspects against the US? The far-right and conspiracy theorist publications found in Tamerlan Tsarnaev's apartment appear to have been supplied by an elderly man befriended by the brothers through their mother's job as a home health aide, the Wall Street Journal finds. A lawyer for the family of Donald Larking, a 67-year-old who suffered brain damage when he was shot in a robbery 40 years ago, says Larking was obsessed with conspiracy theories and shared publications with the brothers that questioned the Holocaust and accused the US or Israeli governments of being behind 9/11 and the Newtown school shooting. Larking also supplied the brothers with copies of a white supremacist newspaper published in Alabama. He became so close to Tamerlan that he converted to Islam and began attending the local mosque with him, says the lawyer, who stresses that the shooting badly impaired the elderly man's \"awareness of the realities of the world\" and his ability to make decisions, the AP reports. Larking, who still attends the mosque, has sunk into \"depression and anger\" since the Boston Marathon bombing and believes his friends were the victims of another conspiracy, the lawyer says.\n\nA 21-year-old Baltimore County man died in the hospital three days after being repeatedly punched by officers responding to his 911 call, the Guardian reports. According to the Baltimore Sun, Tawon Boyd called 911 early last Sunday. He told officers his girlfriend, Deona Styron, had \"got him intoxicated and is secretly recording him.\" Boyd's grandmother, Linda Burch, says Boyd \"was acting...like he was on something.\" Police noted he seemed \"confused and paranoid,\" and it was clear he \"needed to be taken to the hospital.\" But Boyd started trying to get into police cars and resisted attempts to restrain him, resulting in minor injuries to three officers. Based on the police report, it doesn't appear Boyd was trying to hurt the officers. He was holding onto one of the officer's shirts when the officer punched him twice in the face. At that point, the family's lawyer, Latoya Francis-Williams, says Boyd was \"literally attacked\" by officers. She says they got on top of him and \"really started wailing.\" \u201cI kept telling them stop before they hurt him,\u201d Burch tells the Sun. \u201cThey told me to go across the street before they lock me up.\u201d WBAL reports a medic gave Boyd haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug, to calm him down. An autopsy is now looking into whether the drug played a role in Boyd's death Wednesday from heart and kidney failure. Boyd's family is accusing the police of using too much force. \u201cMr. Boyd was in need of medical attention, and the police responded with violence,\u201d Francis-Williams tells the Sun."]}, {"generated_summaries": ["Carrie Fisher is most widely known for her turn as Princess Leia in the hugely popular Star Wars films, but the daughter of two entertainers \u2014 actress Debbie Reynolds and singer Eddie Fisher \u2014 was also an acclaimed author renowned for her trenchant wit.The following is a sampling of memorable lines attributed to Fisher, who died Tuesday after suffering a heart attack during a Dec. 23 flight from London to Los Angeles.She leaves behind her daughter, Billie Lourd, her brother, Todd Fisher, her mother, Debbie Reynolds \u2014 and her French bulldog, Gary.Gary Fisher is a celebrity in his own right \u2014 he traveled widely with Fisher and was a star on Instagram and Twitter.The research findings, which are published in the journal PLOS Biology, reveal a potential early step in the emergence of the elaborate language systems we use today.Researchers at the Universities of Exeter and Zurich discovered that the chestnut-crowned babbler \u2014 a highly social bird found in the Australian Outback \u2014 has the ability to convey new meaning by rearranging the meaningless sounds in its calls.This is similar to how humans form meaningful words.The findings could help in the understanding of how language evolved in humans, researchers report in the online journal \"PLOS Biology.\".", "SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) The leaders of North and South Korea will hold a summit in Pyongyang in September, both countries announced Monday.It will be the third in-person meeting between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.The two first met in April, pledging to forge closer relations and work to formally end the Korean War in an agreement called the Panmunjom Declaration.They then held an impromptu meeting in May at the demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas.Reese, who worked for the Mirror Group as well as the New of the World, is also accused of using a specialist computer hacker in July 2006 to steal information about MI6 agents who had infiltrated the Provisional IRA.The Guardian has previously identified other suspected targets of Rees, including Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, George Michael, Linford Christie, Gary Lineker, Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan, and the family of the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe.With many of them, it is not yet clear precisely what form of surveillance Rees and his agency, Southern Investigations, were using.Questions may lie in the \"boxloads\" of paperwork the Metropolitan police are believed to have seized from Rees.The allegations were made after Mr Rees was named by Tom Watson MP.He told the House of Commons yesterday that Scotland Yard had evidence against the investigator but have said it falls outside the scope of their investigation.It is understood that the reason the allegations fall outside the boundaries of the investigation, codenamed Operation Weeting, is because they do not relate to phone hacking, but other forms of illegal intrusion.The North has demanded their immediate return.The South Korean government has claimed that the North Korean women defected to the South of their own will.The group defection has been causing controversy amid claims that some of them were duped into coming to the country.The website claimed that those workers were coerced into the South and sending them back would be a \"touchstone\" by which the Seoul government's commitment to carrying out the April inter-Korean summit agreement can be tested.It also claimed that any delay in resolving the issue could affect the planned reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War at the Mount Kumgang resort on the North's east coast next month, an event in line with the agreement their leaders reached in a historic summit in April.The U.S. government's actions are in response to growing intelligence that shows a", "In accordance with the time-honored \"the bigger they are, the harder they fall\" principle, Steven Spielberg's The BFG took a giant-sized dive at the box office over the holiday break.Despite working with a $140 million budget, the hopeful Disney blockbuster could only muster up a meager $22.2 million from domestic audiences, with an additional $3.9 million from overseas markets.For scale, consider that alarm klaxons started sounding when Alice Through the Looking Glass put up $33.5 million at the end of May.The PG film, based on Roald Dahl's beloved book of the same name about a giant (Mark Rylance) who strikes up a friendship with a young orphan girl (Ruby Barnhill), is the first movie Spielberg has directed for powerhouse Disney \u2014 and the hope was it could strike a chord like his classic E.T.

Essentially, \"it's a very basic form of word generation,\" researcher Andy Russell tells the BBC. The team started out by listening to chestnut-crowned babbler birds. Rather than sing, they produce \"discrete calls made up of smaller, acoustically distinct individual sounds,\" an expert says in a press release. Two sounds, identified as \"A\" and \"B,\" kept getting repeated. For example, the birds used an \"AB\" call to tell other birds where they were while in flight (listening birds would look to the sky), while a \"BAB\" call told chicks it was feeding time (listening birds would look at nests). Rearranging the sounds of the flight call to produce the latter call showed no alteration in the birds' behavior, and vice versa, proving the individual sounds were in fact the same. \"Although the two babbler bird calls are structurally very similar, they are produced in totally different behavioral contexts and listening birds are capable of picking up on this,\" a researcher explains. Russell adds, per the Christian Science Monitor, the babblers may communicate this way because it's easier to swap existing sounds than make up new ones. What's perhaps most fascinating is that researchers believe the birds' \"B\" sound differentiates the meaning of the call. In other words, it's the \"c\" that discerns the words \"cat\" and \"at\" in the English language. Such distinguishing elements are called phonemes, and this basic example \"might help us understand how the ability to generate new meaning initially evolved in humans,\" an expert says. \"It could be that when phoneme structuring first got off the ground in our hominid ancestors, this is the form it initially took.\" Russell says the ability likely exists in other animals.

Speaking to reporters Friday from his New Jersey golf club, flanked by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, and National Security Adviser HR McMaster, Trump offered what Reuters calls a \"surprise escalation\" on the US response to Venezuela's current political upheaval, in which more than 120 people have been killed and thousands arrested over the past four months. \"Venezuela is not very far away, and the people are suffering and they are dying,\" Trump told reporters, per the Hill. \"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary.\" When pressed by reporters on whether that meant the US would lead an operation in the South American country, Trump replied, \"We don't talk about it, but a military operation\u2014a military option\u2014is certainly something that we could pursue.\" The US just hit Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro with financial sanctions in late July, with a statement from Trump noting: \"Maduro is not just a bad leader. He is now a dictator.\" The Pentagon told Reuters it has yet to receive any instructions from the president regarding Venezuela.

Vanity Fair remembers when Fisher, in her one-woman show Wishful Drinking, explained why she's not wearing underwear in A New Hope, the answer to which explains why she wanted her obituary to read: \"I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.\" Celebrities of all stripes are eulogizing Fisher, and io9 is updating a massive list of their tributes to her, including the following from Steven Spielberg: \"She didn't need the Force; she was a force of nature.\" Meanwhile, Jezebel argues Fisher was an unexpected style icon, who recently angered the French by wearing flats and bringing Gary on the Cannes red carpet. \"She dressed for the part of herself exclusively, and it was wonderful.\" Speaking of Gary, NPR says \"it's impossible to miss the buoyant personalities of both Fishers\" in a recent interview. \"He sits with me on the plane,\" Fisher says. \"Frequently, he sits in the chair, and I sit on the ground.\" CNN has a list of seven things you didn't know about Fisher, including that she's a prolific and well-regarded script doctor, having improved the scripts for Sister Act and Hook, among many others, while also punching up her own Star Wars dialogue.

The leaders of North and South Korea will meet again sometime in September, their third such meeting in five months, reports CNN. This time, however, the South's Moon Jae-in will travel to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Jong Un. High-level officials from the two nations announced the meeting after talks in the Demilitarized Zone on Monday. No agenda has been released, but the two sides have been discussing everything from a possible peace declaration to economic projects, notes Reuters. One potential sore spot: The plight of 12 North Korean women now in South Korea as restaurant workers. The North claims they were kidnapped\u2014or perhaps tricked into defecting\u2014and must be returned, while the South maintains they defected of their own accord in 2016 through China, per Yonhap News. \"If our female citizens' repatriation issue is not resolved as quickly as possible, it could serve as an obstacle not just to the planned reunions of separated families between the two Koreas but also to the overall inter-Korean relations,\" said Uriminzokkiri, a propaganda website for the North, last month. South Korean officials declined to say if the issue came up in Monday's talks.\n\nThe News of the World hacking scandal just got even more royal: Kate Middleton was a victim. But it was her bank account, not her phone, that was hacked, so the incident falls outside Operation Weeting, Scotland Yard\u2019s phone hacking investigation.

Rees also targeted Tony Blair and other high-profile victims, a member of parliament told the House of Commons yesterday. The MP wants the phone hacking inquiry expanded, and the Metropolitan Police force is considering investigating the new allegations.

And this was apparently no idle chatter: CNN reports that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was in the \"final stages of planning for an unspecified attack,\" with particular concern about the US embassy in Yemen between today and Tuesday. The timing dovetails with the end of Ramadan. \u201cThere is a significant threat stream and we\u2019re reacting to it,\u201d Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tells ABC News for its This Week program. He says it is \u201cmore specific\u201d than usual, though the exact target is unspecified. \u201cThe intent is to attack Western, not just US interests.\" Rep. Peter King made a similar point to CNN: The information is \"the most specific I've seen,\" he says, adding, \"We are focused on the Middle East, but it's a potential series of attacks that really could be almost anyplace.\"", "- With a $140 million budget and an opening weekend take of only $24 million, The BFG is poised to be Steven Spielberg's biggest flop in 37 years, Rolling Stone reports. That's left people wondering if the man who essentially invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws has lost his summertime feeling. Here's what some of the experts are saying: Slash Film argues you can't blame Spielberg for the failure, as he's far from the first director to flop when adapting a story by Roald Dahl. In fact, only one film based on a Dahl book\u2014Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\u2014has made more than $34 million in US theaters. The Wrap has a list of seven reasons The BFG bombed, from \"Roald Dahl is no JK Rowling\" to a lack of stars and a confusing title. The BFG might be proof it's time for Spielberg to step away from family films, according to the Hollywood Reporter, which points out the director hasn't had a hit family film since Hook a quarter of a century ago. He's had better luck with recent grown-up fare like Lincoln and Bridge of Spies. The Wall Street Journal details Spielberg's history of being able to \"bounce back\" after cinematic disappointments, something he should have a good chance of doing with his next three films currently including a historical drama, a science-fiction movie based on a popular book, and an Indiana Jones sequel. But the \"reason this stings\" is because every other time Spielberg disappointed at the box office, it was with a \"good for you\" film, according to Forbes. Whereas The BFG was intended as a money-maker for the studio. Finally, Movie Pilot argues that the failure of The BFG shouldn't count against any future Spielberg or Dahl movies. \"The main issue of the movie is more about being unremarkable than disastrous.\u201d\n\nGolf may be \"a good walk, spoiled,\" but at least it doesn't spoil your life expectancy. In fact, a new study finds that heavy cardio sports like cycling and rowing do nothing to help you live longer than playing golf or cricket, reports the Wall Street Journal. Researchers looked at mortality rates in 9,889 Olympic athletes who completed from 1896 to 1936 in 43 types of sports, and surprisingly found that those who competed in intense activities did not live any longer than those who curled, shot guns, played cricket, or golfed. \"Engaging in cycling and rowing (high cardiovascular intensity) had no added survival benefit compared with playing golf or cricket (low cardiovascular intensity),\" says the study. One theory is that intensive exercise over the long-term also leads to injuries and damage that balance out the benefits of such exercise. \"Over time, this will result in an accumulation of damage, which can be explained as a form of aging,\" says a study author.

John Podesta told CNN's State of the Union that Comey should have reviewed the information more thoroughly before making the decision public. Now, Podesta says, Comey should explain why \"he took this unprecedented step, particularly when he said himself in the letter to the Hill that these (emails) may not even be significant.\" The candidate herself kept up the attack on Comey, notes CNN, telling a crowd on Saturday that \"it's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election. In fact, it's not just strange, it's unprecedented and it's deeply troubling because voters deserve to get full and complete facts.\" Elsewhere: Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says Comey was between a rock and a hard place, and could have been accused of meddling with the election if he hadn't made the disclosure. Meanwhile, Team Trump is walking back its previous criticism of the FBI's handling of the investigation into Clinton's email. Tim Kaine says Comey needs to tell the public if he hasn't yet reviewed any of the emails considered \"pertinent\" to the investigation, and says that as far as the campaign knows, Comey \"knows nothing about the content of these emails.\" He calls it a \"distraction\" but says the Clinton campaign will \"power forward\" during the last 10 days. Mike Pence says the scandal shows that Clinton is \"just a risky choice in this election.\" He adds that Trump has \"made it clear we'll have the resources we need,\" and praises his \"incredible generosity.\" Clinton's close relationship with top aide Huma Abedin is being put to the test, reports the New York Times. The AP notes that Team Clinton is thus far standing by Abedin, with campaign manager Robby Mook saying he's \"absolutely\" confident that Abedin fully complied with the FBI.", "- Wet weather and hailstorms combined to make this year's Champagne harvest\u2014the real capital C stuff from France\u2014the worst in 40 years, reports BloombergBusinessweek. Damaged vineyards in the Champagne region yielded 40% fewer grapes this year, says an industry spokesman in Paris. The only good news is that this New Year's Eve won't be affected because bottles typically age 15 months. Generally speaking, it's been a lousy year for grapes all across Europe, notes the Huffington Post.\n\nThe fallout from Anthony Kennedy's bombshell decision to retire from the Supreme Court continues to resonate, with President Trump saying he's \"honored\" that Kennedy has given him an opportunity to pick a successor. Of course, getting him confirmed is another issue, and the Hill digs into the political logistics in the Senate. Republicans have the numbers, but two wild cards are Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: At Vox, Ezra Klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an \"insane\" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the White House and the other the Senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? Reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty. The story notes that of the 276 majority opinions written by Kennedy, 92 came in 5-4 decisions.\n\nChina issued a warning to its citizens in the Philippines yesterday, telling them to \"avoid going out at all if possible,\" because a war may be brewing between the two countries, the Telegraph reports. What is this war over? A few rocks in the South China Sea. Both countries lay claim to the Scarborough Shoal\u2014and, more importantly, to the fish-rich waters around it. One Chinese TV station aired footage of a reporter defiantly raising China's flag on one of those rocks. Chinese state-run media has warned that there will be a \"small-scale war\" if the Philippines doesn't back down, Voice of America reports. China's state-owned tourism company broke off ties with the country yesterday over today's scheduled protest outside the Chinese embassy building in Manila. China's foreign minister today accused the Philippine government of encouraging the protest, and said it would complicate and escalate the situation and endanger Chinese nationals in the Philippines."]}]
