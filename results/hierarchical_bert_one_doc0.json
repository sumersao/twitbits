An emboldened Ukraine today said that it would not reopen ceasefire negotiations until the rebels had laid down their weapons entirely, the AP reports. The once undermanned and outgunned Ukrainian force is now noticeably better armed, using buses and pickup trucks alongside its armored vehicles to transport what the Telegraph describes as a \"motley mix\" of police, special forces, and militiamen. Ukraine says it has succeeded in sealing the Russian border, preventing troops and weapons from flowing to the rebels. But Vladimir Putin has been suspiciously silent, ignoring the separatists' increasingly urgent pleas for help, and many are speculating that he aims to cut his losses, having already taken the real prize of Crimea, the Wall Street Journal reports. Observers believe Moscow has ruled out any military intervention, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov struck a decidedly peaceful tone at a news conference, saying, \"A quick end to the bloodshed is in our common interest.\" But one US official cautioned against declaring victory. \"There is only one person who knows what Putin is planning,\" he said, \"and that is Putin.\"\n\nWeird news from the land of Charlie Sheen: The troubled actor has managed to irk a group of 9/11 truthers, which is now threatening to protest in front of his live shows. Members of the 9/11 Truth Movement, who believe 9/11 was a conspiracy, feel Sheen has betrayed them. Sheen was once very vocal about his belief in the truther movement (he said the World Trade Center collapse looked like a \"controlled demolition\"), but instead of \"asking hard questions about what happened on 9/11 and the resulting wars,\" a member tells TMZ, Sheen has been \"bragging about smoking crack and sleeping with hookers.\" In other Sheen-related news from TMZ, ex Brooke Mueller is back in rehab after a weeklong binge, having refused a drug test and engaged in some other strange behavior\u2014click here for more.\n\nSienna Miller is set to join the growing list of outraged public figures taking legal action over phone-hacking by reporters at Britain's News of the World. Lawyers for the star say she plans to add her name to those seeking a review of how the police handled the case and sources at the Rupert-Murdoch owned paper say she's taking steps toward suing it because reporters allegedly listened to her voicemails, the Guardian reports. (For background and opinion on the scandal, click here.) Miller's friends say she changed her number after noticing signs that somebody else was listening to her voicemail, but jailed reporter Glen Mulcaire appears to have obtained her new number as well, although police didn't notify her when they found her PIN code in his possession. A former News of the World reporter who says his editor asked him to hack phones was interviewed by British police last night, the BBC reports."}]
